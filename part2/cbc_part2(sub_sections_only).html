<h3>SECTION 3101F [SLC] INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p><b>3101 F.1 General.</b> The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand oil spill prevention and response act of 1990 (act), as amended, authorized the California State Lands Commission (SLC) to regulate marine oil terminals (MOTs) in order to protect public health, safety and the environment. The authority for this regulation is contained in Sections 8755 and 8756 of the California Public Resources Code. This act defines “oil” as any kind of petroleum, liquid hydrocarbons, or petroleum products or any fraction or residues thereof, including but not limited to, crude oil, bunker fuel, gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, oil sludge, oil refuse, oil mixed with waste, and liquid distillates from unprocessed natural gas. The provisions of this chapter regulate marine oil terminals as defined under this act.</p>
<p><b>3101F.2 Purpose.</b> The purpose of this code is to establish minimum engineering, inspection and maintenance criteria for MOTs in order to prevent oil spills and to protect public health, safety and the environment. This code does not, in general, address operational requirements. Relevant provisions from existing codes, industry standards, recommended practices, regulations and guidelines have been incorporated directly or through reference, as part of this code.</p>
<p>Where there are differing requirements between this code and/or references cited herein, the choice of application shall be subject to approval of the Marine Facilities Division (Division) of the SLC.</p>
<p>In special circumstances where certain requirements of these standards cannot be met, alternatives that provide an equal or better protection of the public health, safety and the environment shall be subject to Division approval.</p>
<p><b>3101F.3 Applicability.</b> The provisions of this chapter are applicable to the evaluation of existing MOTs and design of new MOTs in California. Each provision is classified as New (N), Existing (E), or Both (N/E) and shall be applied accordingly. If no classification is indicated, the classification shall be considered to be (N/E).</p>
<p>Existing (E) requirements apply to MOTs that are in operation on the date this code is adopted. For these MOTs, equivalent or in-kind replacement of existing equipment, short pipeline sections, or minor modification of existing components shall also be subject to the existing (E) requirements.</p>
<p>New (N) requirements apply to:</p>
<ol>
<li>A MOT or berthing system (Subsection 3102F.1.3) that commences or recommences operation with a new or modified operations manual after adoption of this code.</li>
<li>Addition of new structural components or systems at an existing MOT that are structurally independent of existing components or systems.</li>
<li>Addition of new (nonreplacement) equipment, piping, pipelines, components or systems to an existing MOT.</li>
<li>Major repairs or substantially modified in-place systems.</li>
<li>Any associated major installations or modifications.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>3101F.4 Overview.</b> This Code ensures that a MOT can be safely operated within its inherent structural and equipment-related constraints.</p>
<p>Section 3102F defines minimum requirements for audit, inspection and evaluation of the structural, electrical and mechanical systems on a prescribed periodic basis, or following a significant damage-causing event.</p>
<p>Section 3103F, 3104F and 3107F provide criteria for structural loading, deformation and performance-based evaluation considering earthquake, wind, wave, current, seiche and tsunami effects.</p>
<p>Section 3105F provides requirements for the safe mooring and berthing of tank vessels and barges.</p>
<p>Section 3106F describes requirements for geotechnical hazards and foundation analyses, including consideration of slope stability and soil failure.</p>
<p>Section 3108F provides requirements for fire prevention, detection and suppression including appropriate water and foam volumes.</p>
<p>Sections 3109F through 31011F provide requirements for piping mechanical and electrical equipment.</p>
<p>English units are prescribed herein; however, many of the units in the references are in System International (SI).</p>
<p><b>3101F.5 Risk reduction strategies.</b> Risk reduction strategies, such as pipeline segmentation devices, system flexibility and spill containment devices may be used to reduce the size of a potential oil spill. Such strategies may reduce the MOT risk classification as determined from Table 31F-4-1.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3101F.6 Review requirements.</b></p>
<p><b>3101F.6.1 Quality assurance.</b> All audits, inspections, engineering analyses or design shall be reviewed by a professional having similar or higher qualifications as the person who performed the work, to ensure quality assurance. This review may be performed in-house.</p>

<h3>SECTION 3102F AUDIT AND INSPECTION</h3>
<p class="b"><b>3102F.1 General.</b></p>
<p><b>3102F.1.1 Purpose.</b> Section 3102F defines minimum requirements for audit, inspection, and evaluation of the structural, mechanical and electrical components and systems.</p>
<p><b>3102F.1.2 Audit and inspections types.</b> The audit and inspections described in this Chapter (31F) and 2 CCR 2320 (a) and (b) [2.1] are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Annual inspection</li>
<li>Audit</li>
<li>Post-event inspection</li>
</ol>
<p>Each has a distinct purpose and is conducted either at a defined interval (see Tables 31F-2-1 and 31 F-2-2), as a result of a potentially damaging event or a significant change in operations. In the time between audits and inspections, operators are expected to conduct periodic walk-down examinations of the MOT to detect potentially unsafe conditions.</p>
<p><b>3102F.1.3 Berthing systems.</b> For the purpose of assigning structural ratings and documenting the condition of mechanical and electrical systems, an MOT shall be divided into independent “berthing systems.” A berthing system consists of the wharf and supporting structure, mechanical  systems as defined in Title 2 CCR §2560 and 2561 (n).</p>
<p>For example, a MOT consisting of wharves with three berths adjacent to the shoreline could contain three independent “berthing systems” if the piping does not route through adjacent berths. Therefore, a significant defect that would restrict the operation of one berth would have no impact on the other two berths. Conversely, if a T-head Pier, with multiple berths sharing a trestle that supports all piping to the shoreline, had a significant deficiency on the common trestle, the operation of all berths could be adversely impacted. This configuration is classified as a single berthing system.</p>
<p>The physical boundaries of a berthing system may exclude unused sections of a structure. Excluded sections must be physically isolated from the berthing system. Expansion joints may provide this isolation.</p>
<p><b>3102F.1.4 Records.</b> All MOTs shall have records reflecting current, as-built conditions for all berthing systems. Records shall include, but not be limited to modifications and/or replacement of structural components, electrical or mechanical equipment or relevant operational changes, new construction including design drawings, calculations, engineering analyses, soil borings, equipment manuals, specifications, shop drawings, technical and maintenance manuals and documents.</p>
<p>Chronological records and reports of annual inspections, audits and post-event inspections and documentation of equipment or structural changes shall be maintained.</p>
<p>Records shall be indexed and be readily accessible to the Division (see 2 CCR Section 2320 (c) (2)) [2.1].</p>
<p><b>3102F.1.5 Baseline inspection.</b> If “as-built” or subsequent modification drawings are not available, incomplete or inaccurate,</p>
<p>the audit must include a baseline inspection to gather data in sufficient detail to adequately evaluate the MOT.</p>
<p>The level of detail required shall be such that structural member sizes, connection and reinforcing details are documented, if required in the structural analysis. In addition, the strength and/or ductility characteristics of construction materials shall be determined, as appropriate. Nondestructive testing, partially destructive testing and/or laboratory testing methods may be used.</p>
<p>All fire, piping, mechanical and electrical systems shall be documented as to location, capacity, operating limits and physical conditions.</p>
<p><b>3102F.2 Annual inspection.</b> The annual inspection required by 2 CCR 2320 (a)(1) [2.1], may include an engineering examination of the topside and underside areas of the dock, including the splash zone. The Division shall perform the inspection, with cooperation from the owner/operator. Observations will be recorded and a report of violations and deficiencies shall be provided to the operator.</p>
<p>Subject to operating procedures, a boat shall be provided to facilitate the inspection of the dock undersides and piles down to the splash zone. If a boat is not available or the under dock inspection cannot be performed by the Division during the annual inspection, the MOT operator shall carry out or cause to be carried out, such an inspection. The operator will then provide the Division with a report detailing the examination results including photographs, videos and sketches as necessary to accurately depict the state of the underside of the dock.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3102F.3 Audit.</b></p>
<p><b>3102F.3.1 Objective.</b> The objective of the audit is to review structural, mechanical and electrical systems on a prescribed periodic basis to verify that each berthing system is fit for its specific defined purpose. </p>
<p><b>3102F.3.2 Overview.</b> The initial audit shall include above water and underwater structural inspections, mooring, berthing and structural evaluations, and electrical/mechanical systems evaluation. The audit is performed by a multidisciplinary team of engineers, qualified inspectors and may include Division representatives.</p>
<p>The above water inspection involves an examination of all structural, mechanical and electrical components above the waterline. Structural defects and their severity shall be documented, but the exact size and location of each deficiency is typically not required.</p>
<p> limited visibility, heavy marine growth, restricted inspection times because of environmental factors (currents, water temperatures, etc.) or a very large number of piles.</p>
<p>A global condition assessment rating (CAR) shall be assigned to above and underwater structural systems (Table 31F-2-5).</p>
<p>Remedial action priorities (RAP) shall be assigned for component deficiencies (Table 31F-2-6). Recommendations for remediation and/or upgrading shall be prescribed as necessary.</p>
<p>An audit is not considered complete until the audit report is received by the Division.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3102F.3.3 Schedule.</b></p>
<p><b>3102F.3.3.1 Initial audit.</b> Table 31F-2-1 provides the deadlines for the submission of the initial audit report. The MOT classification in Table 31F-2-1 is determined from the higher assigned risk classification obtained from Table 31F-4-1.</p>
<p>For a new MOT berthing system, the initial audit shall be performed within three years of commencement of operations.</p>
<p><b>3102F.3.3.2 Subsequent audits.</b> An above water audit of structural, mechanical and electrical systems shall be completed at a maximum interval of 3 years. This interval may be reduced, based on the recommendation of the audit team leader, and with the approval of the Division, depending on the extent and rate of deterioration or other factors.</p>
<p>The maximum interval for underwater audits is dependent upon the condition of the facility, the construction material type and/or the environment at the mudline, as shown in Table 31F-2-2.</p>
<p> from previous audits may be referenced. However, if there is a significant change in a berthing system, or when deterioration or damage must be considered, a new analysis may be required.</p>
<p>The Division may require an audit to justify changes in the use of a berthing system. An example of such change would be in the berthing and mooring configuration of larger or smaller vessels relative to dolphin and fender spacing, and potential resultant modification to operational environmental limitations (e.g., wind speed).</p>
<p>Subsequent audits of the above water and underwater structures and mechanical and electrical systems may or may not be performed concurrently, depending upon the required inspection intervals based on the prior audit report.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3102F.3.4 Audit team.</b></p>
<p><b>3102F.3.4.1 Project manager.</b> The audit shall be conducted by a multidisciplinary team under the direction of a project manager representing the MOT. The project manager shall have specific knowledge of the MOT and may serve other roles on the audit team.</p>
<p><b>3102F.3.4.2 Audit team leader.</b> The audit team leader shall lead the on-site audit team and shall be responsible for directing field activities, including the inspection of all structural, mechanical and electrical systems. The team</p>
<p>leader shall be a California registered civil or structural engineer and may serve other roles on the audit team.</p>
<p><b>3102F.3.4.3 Structural inspection team.</b> The structural inspection shall be conducted under the direction of a registered civil or structural engineer.</p>
<p>All members of the structural inspection team shall be graduates of a 4-year civil/structural engineering, or closely related (ocean/coastal) engineering curriculum, and shall have been certified as an Engineer-in-Training; or shall be technicians who have completed a course of study in structural inspections. The minimum acceptable course in structural inspections shall include 80 hours of instruction specifically related to structural inspection, followed by successful completion of a comprehensive examination. An example of an acceptable course is the U.S. Department of Transportation’s  as a Level IV Bridge Inspector by the National Institute of Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET) shall also be acceptable [2.2].</p>
<p>For underwater inspections, the registered civil or structural engineer directing the underwater structural  equivalent and shall actively participate in the inspection, by personally conducting a minimum of 25 percent of the underwater examination [2.2].</p>

<p><b>3102F.3.5.1 Above water structural inspection.</b> The above water inspection shall include all accessible components above +3 ft MLLW. Accessible components shall be defined as those components above and below deck that are reachable without the need for excavation or extensive removal of materials that may impair visual inspection.The above water inspection shall include but not be limited to the following:</p>
<ol>

<li>Navigation aids</li>
<li>Platforms, ladders, stairs, handrails and gangways</li>
<li>Backfill (sinkholes/differential settlement)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>3102F.3.5.2 Underwater structural inspection.</b> The underwater inspection shall include all accessible components from +3 ft MLLW to the mudline, including the slope and slope protection, in areas immediately surrounding the MOT. The water depth at the berth(s) shall be evaluated, verifying the maximum or loaded draft specified in the MOT's Operations Manual (2 CCR 2385 (d)) [2.1].</p>
<p>The underwater structural inspection shall include the Level I, II and III inspection efforts, as shown in Tables 31F-2-3 and 31F-2-4. The underwater inspection levels of effort are described below, per [2.2]:</p>
<p>Level I—Includes a close visual examination, or a tactile examination using large sweeping motions of the hands where visibility is limited. Although the Level I effort is often referred to as a "swim-by" inspection, it must be detailed enough to detect obvious major damage or deterioration due to overstress or other severe deterioration. It should confirm the continuity of the full length of all members and confirm the continuity of the full length of all members and detect undermining or exposure of normally buried elements. A Level I effort may also include limited probing of the substructure and adjacent channel bottom.</p>
<p>Level II—A detailed inspection which requires marine growth removal from a representative sampling of components within the structure. For piles, a 12-inch high band should be cleaned at designated locations, generally near the low waterline, at the mud-line, and midway between the low waterline and the mudline. On a rectangular pile, the marine growth removal should include at least three sides; on an octagon pile, at least six sides; on a round pile, at least three-fourths of the perimeter. On large diameter piles, 3 ft or greater, marine growth removal should be effected on 1 ft by 1 ft areas at four locations approximately equally spaced around the perimeter, at each elevation. On large solid faced elements such as retaining structures, marine growth removal should be effected on 1 ft by 1 ft areas at the three specified elevations. The inspection should also focus on typical areas of weakness, such as attachment points and welds. TheLevel II effort is intended to detect and identify damaged and deteriorated areas that may be hidden by surface biofouling. The thoroughness of marine growth removal should be governed by what is necessary to discern the condition of the underlying structural material. Removal of all biofouling staining is generally not required.</p>
<p>Level III—A detailed inspection typically involving nondestructive or partially-destructive testing, conducted to detect hidden or interior damage, or to evaluate material homogeneity.</p>
<p>Typical inspection and testing techniques include the use of ultrasonics, coring or boring, physical material sampling and in-situ hardness testing. Level III testing is generally limited to key structural areas, areas which are suspect, or areas which may be representative of the underwater structure.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3102F.3.5.3 Special inspection considerations.</b></p>
<p><b>3102F.3.5.3.1 Coated components.</b> For coated steel components, Level I and Level II efforts should focus on the evaluation of the integrity and effectiveness of the coating. The piles should be inspected without damaging the coating. Level III efforts should include</p>
<p>ultrasonic thickness measurements without removal of the coating, where feasible.</p>
<p><b>3102F.3.5.3.2 Encased components.</b> For steel, concrete or timber components that have been encased, the Level I and II efforts should focus on the evaluation of the integrity of the encasement. If evidence of significant damage to the encasement is present, or if evidence of significant deterioration of the underlying component is present, then the damage evaluation should consider whether the encasement was provided for protection and/or structural capacity. Encasements should not typically be removed for an audit.</p>
<p>For encasements on which the formwork has been left in place, the inspection should focus on the integrity of the encasement, not the formwork. Level I and Level II efforts in such cases should concentrate on the top and bottom of the encasement. For concrete components, if deterioration, loss of bonding, or other significant problems with the encasement are suspected, it may be necessary to conduct a special inspection, including coring of the encasement and laboratory evaluation of the materials.</p>
<p><b>3102F.3.5.3.3 Wrapped components.</b> For steel, concrete or timber components that have been wrapped, the Level I and II efforts should focus on the evaluation of the integrity of the wrap. Since the effectiveness of a wrap may be compromised by removal, and since the removal and re-installation of wraps is time-consuming, it should not be routinely done. However, if evidence of significant damage exists, or if the effectiveness of the wraps is in question, then samples should be removed to facilitate the inspection and evaluation. The samples may be limited to particular zones or portions of members if damage is suspected, based on the physical evidence of potential problems. A minimum sample size of three members should be used. A five-percent sample size, up to 30 total members, may be adequate as an upper limit.</p>
<p>For wrapped timber components, Level III efforts should consist of removal of the wraps from a representative sample of components in order to evaluate the condition of the timber beneath the wrap. The sample may be limited to particular zones or portions of the members if damage is suspected (e.g., at the mudline/bottom of wrap or in the tidal zone). The sample size should be determined based on the physical evidence of potential problems and the aggressiveness of the environment. A minimum sample size of three members should be used. A five-percent sample size, up to 30 total members, may be adequate as an upper limit.</p>
<p><b>3102F.3.5.4 Mechanical electrical equipment.</b> The inspection of mechanical and electrical equipment shall include but not be limited to the following components and systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Loading arms</li>
<li>Cranes and lifting equipment, including cables</li>
<li>Piping/manifolds and supports</li>
<li>Oil transfer hoses</li>

<p><b>3102F.3.6.1 Terminal operating limits.</b> The physical boundaries of the facility shall be defined by the berthing system operating limits, along with the vessel size limits and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The audit shall include a “Statement of Terminal Operating Limits,” which must provide a concise statement of the purpose of each berthing system in terms of operating limits. This description must at least include, the minimum and maximum vessel sizes, including Length Overall (LOA), beam, and maximum draft with associated displacement (see Fig. 31F-2-1).</p>

<p>Based on inspection results, structural analyses and engineering judgment, CARs shall be assigned on a global basis, independently for above and underwater structures. The CARs defined in Table 31F-2-S shall be used for this purpose. The CAR documents the structural fitness-for-purpose. Structural component deficiencies may be assigned RAPs as per Table 31F-2-6. The assigned ratings shall remain in effect until all the significant corrective action has been completed to the satisfaction of the division, or until completion of the next audit.</p>
<p><b>3102F.3.6.4 Mechanical and electrical systems.</b> An evaluation of all mechanical and electrical systems and components shall be performed in accordance with Sections 3108F through 3111F of these standards.

<li>Updated RAPs and CARs</li>
<li>Supporting documentation with calculations and/or relevant data</li>
</ol>
<p><b>3102F.4 Post-Event inspection.</b> A post-event inspection is a focused inspection following a significant, potentially damage-causing event such as an earthquake, storm, vessel impact, fire, explosion or tsunami. The primary purpose is to assess the integrity of structural, mechanical and electrical systems. This</p>
<p>assessment will determine the operational status and/or any remedial measures required.</p>
<p><b>3102F.4.1 Notification and action plan.</b> Notification as per 2 CCR 2325(e) [2.1] shall be provided to the local area Division field office. The notification shall include, as a minimum:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brief description of the event</li>
<li>Brief description of the nature, extent and significance of any damage observed as a result of the event</li>
<li>Operational status and any required restrictions</li>
<li>Statement as to whether a Post-Event inspection will be carried out</li>
</ol>
<p>The Division may carry out or cause to be carried out, a post-event inspection. In the interim, the Division may direct a change in the operations manual, per 2 CCR 2385 (f)(3) [2.1].</p>
<p>If a post-event inspection is required, an action plan shall be submitted to the Division within five (5) days after the event. This deadline may be extended in special circumstances. This deadline may be extended in special circumstances. The action plan shall include the scope of the inspection (above water, underwater, electrical, mechanical systems, physical limits, applicable berthing systems, etc.) and submission date of the final report. The action plan is subject to Division approval.</p>
<p><b>3102F.4.2 Inspection team.</b> The qualifications of the inspection team shall be the same as those prescribed in Section 3102F.3.4. Division representatives may participate in any post-event inspection, as observers, and may provide guidance.</p>
<p><b>3102F.4.3 Scope.</b> The post-event inspection shall focus on the possible damage caused by the event. General observations of long-term or preexisting deterioration such as significant corrosion-related damage or other deterioration should be made as appropriate, but should not be the focus of the inspection. The inspection shall always include an above-water assessment of structural, mechanical and electrical components.</p>
<p>The inspection team leader shall determine the need for, and methodology of, an underwater structural assessment, in consultation with the Division. Above water observations, such as shifting or differential settlement, misalignments, significant cracking or spalling, bulging, etc., shall be used to determine whether or not an underwater assessment is required. Similarly, the inspection team leader shall determine, in consultation with the Division, the need for, and methodology of any supplemental inspections (e.g., special inspections (see Section 3102F.3.5.3).</p>
<p>The following information may be important in determining the need for, and methodology of, the post-event inspection:</p>
<ol>
<li>Earthquakes or vessel or debris impact typically cause damage both above and below the water line. Following a major earthquake, the inspection should focus on components likely to attract highest lateral loads (batter or shorter piles in the rear of the structure, etc.). In case of vessel or debris impact, the inspection effort should focus on components in the path of the impact mass.</li>
<li>Major floods or tsunamis may cause undermining of the structure, and/or scouring at the mud line.</li>
<li>Fire damage varies significantly with the type of the construction materials but all types may be adversely affected. Special inspections (sampling and laboratory testing) shall be conducted, as determined by the inspection team leader, in order to determine the nature and extent of damage.</li>
<li>High wind or wave events often cause damage both above and below the water line. An underwater inspection may be required if damage is visible above the waterline. Structural damage may be potentially increased if a vessel was at the berth during the event. The effects of high wind may be most prevalent on equipment and connections of such equipment to the structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>The methodology of conducting an underwater postevent inspection should be established with due consideration of the structure type and type of damage anticipated. Whereas slope failures or scour may be readily apparent in waters of adequate visibility, overstressing cracks on piles covered with marine growth will not be readily apparent. Where such hidden damage is suspected, marine growth removal should be performed on a representative sampling of components in accordance with the Level II effort requirements described in Section 3102F.3.5.2. The cause of the event will determine the appropriate sample size and locations.</p>
<p> shall be assigned to each berthing system upon completion of the inspection (see Table 31F-2-8). All observations of the above and under water structure, mechanical and electrical components and systems shall be considered in assigning a post-event rating.</p>
<p>Ratings should consider only damage that was likely caused by the event. Pre-existing deterioration such as corrosion damage should not be considered unless the structural integrity is immediately threatened or safety systems or protection of the environment may be compromised.</p>
<p>Assignment of ratings should reflect and overall characterization of the berthing system being rated. The rating shall consider both the severity of the deterioration and the extent to which it is widespread throughout the facility. The fact that the facility was designed for loads that are lower than the current standards for design should have no influence upon the ratings.</p>
<p><b>3102F.4.5 Follow-up actions.</b> Follow-up actions shall be assigned upon completion of the post-event inspection of each berthing system. Table 31F-2-6 specifies remedial action priorities and actions for mechanical and electrical deficiencies. Table 31F-2-7 specifies various options for structural systems. Multiple follow-up actions may be assigned; however, guidance should be provided as to the order in which the follow-up actions should be carried-out. Follow-up actions shall be subject to Division approval.</p>
<p><b>3102F.4.6 Documentation and reporting.</b> Documentation of the specific attributes of each defect shall not be required during a post-event inspection. However, a narrative description of significant damage shall be used. The description shall be consistent with and shall justify the post-event rating assigned.</p>
<p>A report shall be prepared and submitted to the Division upon  and shall, at a minimum, include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brief description of the facility including the physical limits of the structure, type of construction material(s), and the mechanical and electrical systems present</li>
<li>Brief description of the event triggering the inspection</li>
<li>Scope of the inspection (above water, underwater, electrical or mechanical)</li>
<li>Date of the inspection</li>
<li>Names and affiliations of inspection team</li>
<li>Description of the nature, extent and significance of any observed damage resulting from the event</li>
<li>Photographs should be provided to substantiate the descriptions and justify the condition rating</li>
<li>Assignment of a post-event rating</li>
<li>Statement regarding whether the facility is fit to resume operations and, if so, under what conditions</li>
<li>Assignment of follow-up action(s)</li>
<li>Inspection data, drawings, calculations and other relevant engineering materials</li>
<li>Signature and stamp of team leader(s)</li>

<h3>SECTION 3103F STRUCTURAL LOADING CRITERIA</h3>
<p><b>3103F.1 General.</b> Section 3103F establishes the environmental and operating loads acting on the marine oil terminal (MOT) structures and on moored vessel(s). The analysis procedures are presented in Section 3104F – 3107F.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3103F.2 Dead loads.</b></p>
<p><b>3103F.2.1 General.</b> Dead loads shall include the weight of the entire structure, including permanent attachments such as loading arms, pipelines, deck crane, fire monitor tower, gangway structure, vapor control equipment and mooring hardware. Unit weights specified in Section 3103F.2.2 may be used for MOT structures if actual weights are not available.</p>
<p><b>3103F.2.2 Unit weights.</b> The unit weights in Table 31F-3-1 may be used for both existing and new MOTs.</p>
<p><b>3103F.2.3. Equipment and piping Area Loads.</b> The equipment and piping area loads in Table 31F-3-2 may be used, as a minimum, in lieu of detailed as-built data.</p>
<p><b>3103F.3 Live loads and buoyancy.</b> The following vertical live loading shall be considered, where appropriate: uniform loading, truck loading, crane loading and buoyancy. Additionally, MOT specific, nonpermanent equipment shall be identified and used in loading computations.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3103F.4 Earthquake loads.</b></p>
<p><b>3103F.4.1 General.</b> Earthquake loads are described in terms of Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), spectral acceleration and earthquake magnitude. The required seismic analysis procedures (Tables 31F-4-2 and 31F-4-3) are dependent on the risk classification obtained from Table 31F-4-1.</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2 Design earthquake motion parameters.</b> The earthquake ground motion parameters of peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration and earthquake magnitude are modified for site amplification and near fault directivity effects. The resulting values are the design peak ground acceleration (DPGA), design spectral acceleration (DSA) and design earthquake magnitude (DEM).</p>
<p>The peak ground and spectral acceleration may be evaluated using:</p>
<ol>
<li>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) or California Geological Survey [CGS, formerly the California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG)] maps as discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.2,</li>
<li>A site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) as discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.3.</li>
<li>For the Ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme, PSHA results are provided in Section 3103F.4.2.3.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, the DSA values are for 5 percent damping; values at other levels may be obtained as per Section 3103F.4.2.9.</p>
<p>The appropriate probability levels associated with DPGA and DSA for different seismic performance levels are provided in Table 31F-4-2. Deterministic earthquake motions, which are used only for comparison to the probabilistic results, are addressed in Section 3103F.4.2.7.</p>
<p>The evaluation of Design Earthquake Magnitude (DEM), is discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.8. This parameter is required when acceleration time histories (Section 3103F.4.2.10) are addressed or if liquefaction potential (Section 3106F.3) is being evaluated.</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.1 Site classes.</b> The following site classes, defined in Section 3106F.2, shall be used in developing values of DSA and DPGA:</p>
<p>S<sub>A</sub>, S<sub>B</sub>, S<sub>C</sub>, S<sub>D</sub>, S<sub>E</sub> and S<sub>F</sub>.</p>
<p>For S<sub>F</sub>, a site-specific response analysis is required per Section 3103F.4.2.5.</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.2 Earthquake motions from USGS maps.</b> Earthquake ground motion parameters can be obtained from the Maps 29-32 in the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) design map set  These are available as peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values at 5 percent damping for 10 and 2 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years, which correspond to Average Return Periods (ARPs) of 475 and 2,475 years, respectively. The spectral acceleration values are available for 0.2, and 1.0 second spectral periods. In obtaining peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values from the USGS web site, the site location can be specified in terms of site longitude and latitude or the zip code when appropriate. The</p>
<p>resulting values of peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration correspond to surface motions for Site Classification approximately corresponding to the boundary of Site Class S<sub>B</sub> and S <sub>C</sub>.</p>
<p>Once peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values are obtained for 10 and 2 percent probability of exceedence in 50 years, the corresponding values for other probability levels may be obtained. A procedure is presented in subsection 1.6 of Chapter 1 of [3.1].</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.3 Earthquake motions from site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analyses.</b> Peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values can be obtained using site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). In this approach, the seismic sources and their characterization used in the analysis shall be based on the published data from the California Geological Survey, which can be obtained online at the following website:  [3.2].</p>
<p>Appropriate attenuation relationship shall be used to obtain values of peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration at the ground surface for site conditions corresponding to the boundary of Site Class S<sub>B</sub> and S<sub>C</sub>, regardless of the actual subsurface conditions at the site. These results shall be compared to those based on the FEMA/USGS maps discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.2. If the two sets of values are significantly different, a justification for using the characterization chosen shall be provided.</p>
<p>Alternatively, peak ground acceleration and spectral accelerations at the ground surface for the subsurface conditions that actually exist at the site may be directly obtained by using appropriate attenuation relationships in a site-specific PSHA. This approach is not permissible for Site Classes S<sub>E</sub> and S<sub>F</sub>.</p>
<p>For site-specific PSHA, peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values corresponding to the seismic performance level (See Table 31F-4-2) shall be obtained.</p>
<p>For peak ground acceleration, PSHA may be conducted using the “magnitude weighting” procedure in Idriss [3.3]. The actual magnitude weighting values should follow the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) procedures [3.4]. This magnitude weighting procedure incorporates the effects of duration corresponding to various magnitude events in the PSHA results. The resulting peak ground acceleration shall be used only for liquefaction assessment (see Section 3106F.4).</p>
<p>PSHA have been developed for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach [3.5, 3.6] and provide site-specific information for seismic analyses. Table 31F-3-3 provided response spectra, for a 475 year return period earthquake and 5 percent critical damping. Figure 31F-3-1 provides the corresponding spectra for the two ports. Additionally, these references provide spectra for return periods from 72 to 2,500 years.</p>
<p>For the port of Port Hueneme, a PSHA was performed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [3.7] and the results are shown in Table 31F-3-4 and Figure 31F-3-2. These results are provided only for site classification “S<sub>c</sub>” and five percent critical damping. To obtain appropriate values for piles and/or the mudline, the simplified procedures of Section 3103F.4.2.4 may be used.</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.4 Simplified evaluation of site amplification effects.</b> When the MOT Site Class is different from the S<sub>B</sub> S<sub>C</sub> boundary, site amplification and spectral accelerations. This may be accomplished using a simplified method or a site-specific evaluation (Section 3103F.4.2.5).</p>
<p>For a given site class, the following procedure [3.1] presents a simplified method that may be used to incorporate the site amplification effects for peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration computed for the S<sub>B</sub> and S<sub>C</sub>boundary.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the spectral acceleration values at 0.20 and 1.0 second period: <p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_523_02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>F<sub>a</sub>= site coefficient obtained from Table 31F-3-5</p>
<p>F<sub>v</sub>= site coefficient obtained from Table 31F-3-6</p>
<p>S<sub>s</sub>= short period (usually at 0.20 seconds) spectral acceleration value (for the boundary of S<sub>b</sub> and S<sub>c</sub>) obtained using Section 3103F.4.2.2, or at the period corresponding to the peak in spectral acceleration values when obtained from Section 3103F.4.2.3</p>
<p>S<sub>i</sub> = spectral acceleration value (for the boundary of S<sub>B</sub> and S<sub>C</sub>) at 1.0 second period.</p>
<p>S<sub>Xs</sub> = spectral acceleration value obtained using the short period S<sub>s</sub> and factored by Table 31F-3-5 for the Site Class under consideration.</p>
<p>S<sub>Xi</sub>= spectral acceleration value obtained using the 1.0 second period S<sub>1</sub> and factored by Table 31F-3-6 for the Site Class under consideration.</p></li>
<li><p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_523_03.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>PGA<sub>X</sub> = peak ground acceleration corresponding to the Site Class under consideration.</p>
<p>When the value of PGA<sub>X</sub> is less than the peak ground acceleration obtained following Section 3103F.4.2.2 or Section 3103F.4.2.3, and explanation of the results shall be provided.</p></li>
<li>PGA<sub>X</sub>, S<sub>Xs</sub> and S<sub>Xi</sub> constitute three spectral acceleration values for the Site Class under consideration corresponding to periods of 0.S<sub>s</sub> (usually 0.2 second), and 1.0 second, respectively.</li>
<li>The final response spectra, without consideration for near-fault directivity effects, values of S<sub>a</sub> for the Site Class under consideration may be obtained using the following equations (for 5 percent critical damping):</li>
</ol>
<p>for 0 &lt; T &lt; 0.2T<sub>0</sub></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_523_04.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>T = Period corresponding to calculated S<sub>0</sub></p>
<p>T<sub>0</sub> = Period at which the constant acceleration and constant velocity regions of the design spectrum intersect</p>
<p>for 0.2T<sub>0</sub> &lt; T &lt; T<sub>0</sub></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_523_05.jpg"/></p>
<p>for T &gt; T<sub>0</sub></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_523_06.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_523_07.jpg"/></p>
<p>The resulting PGA<sub>X</sub> is the DPGA. However, the S<sub>a</sub>(except for the ports of Los Angels, Long Beach and Port Hueneme) shall be modified for near-fault directivity effects, per Section 3103F.4.2.6 to obtain the final DSAs.</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.5 Site-specific evaluation of amplification effects.</b> As an alternative to the procedure presented in Section 3103F.4.2.4, a site-specific response analysis may be performed.  The analysis shall be either an equivalent linear or nonlinear analysis. Appropriate acceleration time histories as discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.10 shall be used.</p>
<p>In general, an equivalent linear analysis using, for  and stiffness of soils are unlikely to change significantly during the seismic shaking, and the level of shaking is not large. A nonlinear analysis should be used when the strength and/or stiffness of soils could significant nonlinearity of soils is expected because of high seismic shaking levels.</p>
<p>The choice of the method used in site response analysis shall be justified considering the expected stress-strain behavior of soils under the shaking level considered in the analysis.</p>
<p>Site-specific site response analysis may be performed using one-dimensional analysis. However, to the extent that MOTs often involve slopes or earth retaining structures, the one-dimensional analysis should be used judiciously. When one-dimensional analysis cannot be justified or is not adequate, two-dimensional equivalent linear or nonlinear response analysis shall be performed. Site-specific response analysis results shall be compared to those based on the simplified method of Section 3103F.4.2.4 for reasonableness.</p>
<p>For the port areas of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme, the resulting response spectra shall not fall below values obtained in Section 3103F.4.2.3.</p>
<p>The peak ground accelerations obtained from this site-specific evaluation are DPGAs and the spectral accelerations are DSAs as long as the near-fault directivity effects addressed in Section 3103F.4.2.6 are appropriately incorporated into the time histories (Section 3103F.4.2.10).</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.6 Directivity effects.</b> When the site is 15 km (9.3 miles) or closer to a seismic source that can significantly affect the site, near-fault directivity effects shall be reflected in the spectral acceleration values and in the</p>
<p>deterministic spectral acceleration values of Section 3103F.4.2. 7. However, Tables 31F-3-3 and 31F-3-4 for the port areas of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme already have these effects included.</p>
<p>Two methods are available for incorporating directivity effects.</p>
<ol>
<li>Directivity effects may be reflected in the spectral acceleration values in a deterministic manner by using, for example, the equation on pg. 213 (and  seismic sources and their characterization developed as part of the deterministic ground motion parameters (Section 3103F.4.2.70) should be used to evaluate the directivity effects. The resulting adjustments in spectral acceleration values may be applied in the probabilistic spectral acceleration values developed per Section 3103F.4.2.4 or 3103F.4.2.5. Such adjustment can be independent of the probability levels of spectral accelerations.</li>
<li>Directivity effects may be incorporated in the results of site specific PSHA per Section 3103F.4.2.3. In this case, the directivity effects will also depend on the probability level of spectral accelerations.</li>
</ol>
<p>If spectral accelerations are obtained in this manner, the effects of site amplification using either Section 3103F.4.2.4, 3103F.4.2.5 or an equivalent method (if justified) shall be incorporated.</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.7 Deterministic earthquake motions.</b> Deterministic ground motions from “scenario” earthquakes may be used for comparison purposes. Deterministic peak ground accelerations and spectral accelerations may be obtained using the “Critical Seismic Source” with maximum earthquake magnitude and its closest appropriate distance to the MOT. “Critical Seismic Source” is that which results in the largest computed medium peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values when appropriate attenuation relationships are used. The values obtained from multiple attenuation relationships should be used to calculate the median peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values.</p>
<p> and spectral acceleration may be obtained from the USGS maps [3.1], corresponding to the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE). In this case, the median values of peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values shall be 213 (see Subsection 1.6 of [3.1]) of the values shown on the USGS maps.</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.8 Design earthquake magnitude.</b> The design earthquake magnitude used in developing site-specific acceleration time histories (Section 3103F.4.2.10) or liquefaction assessment (Section 3106F.3) is obtained using either of the following two methods.</p>
<ol>
<li>The design earthquake may be selected as the largest earthquake magnitude associated with the critical seismic source. The distance shall be taken as the closest distance from the source to the site. The resulting design earthquake shall be associated with all DPGA values for the site, irrespective of probability levels.</li>
<li>The design earthquake (DEQ) may be obtained for each DPGA or DSA value and associated probability level by determining the corresponding dominant distance and magnitude. These are the values of the distance and magnitude that contribute the most to the mean seismic hazards estimates for the probability of interest. They are usually determined by locating the summits of the 3-D surface of contribution of each small interval of magnitude and distance to the total mean hazards estimate. If this 3-D surface shows several modes with approximate weight of more than 20 percent of the total, several DEQs may be considered, and the DEQ leading to the most conservative design parameters shall be used.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.9 Design spectral acceleration for various damping values.</b> Design spectral acceleration (DSA) values at damping other than 5 percent shall be obtained by using a procedure given in [3.1], and is denoted as DSA<sub>d</sub>, The following procedure does not include near-fault directivity effects.</p>
<p>For 0 &lt; T &lt; 0.2 T<sub>0</sub></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_526_02.jpg"/></p>
<p>For 0.2 T<sub>0</sub> &lt; T &lt; T<sub>0</sub></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_526_03.jpg"/></p>
<p>For T &gt; T<sub>0</sub></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_526_04.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>T = period</p>
<p>T<sub>0</sub> = S<sub>X1</sub>/S<sub>XS</sub></p>
<p>B<sub>s</sub> = Coefficient used to adjust the short period spectral response, for the effect of viscous damping.</p>
<p>B<sub>1</sub> = Coefficient used to adjust one-second period spectral response, for the effect of viscous damping</p>
<p>Values of B<sub>s</sub> and B<sub>1</sub> are obtained from Table 31F-3-7.</p>
<p>Such a procedure shall incorporate the near-fault directivity effects when the MOT is 15 km (9.3 miles) or closer to a significant seismic source.</p>
<p><b>3103F.4.2.10 Development of acceleration time histories.</b> When acceleration time histories are utilized, target spectral acceleration values shall be initially selected corresponding to the DSA values at appropriate probability levels. For each set of target spectral acceleration values corresponding to one probability level, at least three sets of horizontal time histories (one or two horizontal acceleration time histories per set) shall be developed.</p>
<p>Initial time histories shall consider magnitude, distance and the type of fault that are reasonably similar to those associated with the conditions contributing most to the probabilistic DSA values. Preferred initial time histories should have their earthquake magnitude and distance to the seismic source similar to the mode-magnitude and mode-distance derived from the PSHA or from appropriate maps. When an adequate number of recorded time histories are not available, acceleration time histories from simulations may be used as supplements.</p>
<p>Scaling or adjustments, either in the frequency domain or in the time domain (preferably), prior to generating acceleration time histories should be kept to a minimum. When the target spectral accelerations include near-fault directivity effects (Section 3103F.4.2.6), the initial time histories should exhibit directivity effects.</p>
<p>When three sets of time histories are used in the analysis, the envelope of the spectral acceleration values from each time history shall be equal to or higher than the target spectral accelerations. If the envelope values fall below the target values, adjustments shall be made to ensure that the spectral acceleration envelope is higher than target spectral accelerations. If the envelope values fall below the target values, adjustments shall be made to ensure that the spectral acceleration envelope is higher than target spectral accelerations. If the envelope is not higher, then a justification shall be provided.</p>
<p>When seven or more sets of time histories are used, the average of the spectral acceleration values from the set of time histories shall be equal or higher than the target spectral acceleration values. If the average values fall below the target values, adjustments shall be made to ensure that average values are higher than the target spectral accelerations. If this is not the case, then an explanation for the use of these particular spectral acceleration values shall be provided.</p>
<p>When three sets of time histories are used in the analysis, the maximum value of each response parameter shall be used in the design, evaluation and rehabilitation. When seven or more sets of time histories are used in the analysis, the average value of each response parameter may be used.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3103F.5 Mooring loads on vessels.</b></p>
<p><b>3103F.5.1 General.</b> Forces acting on a moored vessel may be generated by wind, waves, current, tidal variations, tsunamis, seiches and hydrodynamic effects of passing vessels. Forces from wind and current acting directly on the MOT structure (not through the vessel in the form of mooring and/or breasting loads) shall be determined in Section 3103F.7.</p>
<p>The vessel’s moorings shall be strong enough to hold during all expected conditions of surge, current and weather and long enough to allow adjustment for changes in draft, </p>
<p><b>3103F.5.2 Wind loads.</b> Wind loads on a vessel, moored at a MOT, shall be determined using procedures described in this section. Wind loads shall be calculated for each of the load cases identified in Section 3105F.2.</p>
<p><b>3103F.5.2.1 Design wind speed.</b> The design wind speed is the maximum wind speed of 30-second duration used in the mooring analysis (see Section 3105F).</p>
<p><b>3103F.5.2.1.1 Operating condition.</b> The operating condition is the wind envelope in which a vessel may conduct transfer operations. It is determined from the mooring analysis (Section 3105F). Transfer operations shall cease, at an existing MOT, when the wind exceeds the maximum velocity of the envelope.</p>
<p><b>3103F.5.2.1.2 Survival condition.</b> The survival condition is defined as the state wherein a vessel can remain safely moored at the berth during severe winds. For new MOT<sub>s</sub>, the survival condition threshold is the maximum wind velocity, for a 30-second gust and a 25-year return period, obtained from historical data.</p>
<p>For an existing MOT, a reduced survival condition threshold is acceptable (see Figure 31F-2-1). If the wind rises above these levels, the vessel must depart the berth; it shall be able to depart within 30 minutes </p>
<p>The 30-second duration wind speed shall be determined from the annual maximum wind data. Average annual summaries cannot be used. Maximum wind speed data for eight directions (45-degree increments) shall be obtained. If other duration wind data is available, it shall be adjusted to a 30-second duration, in accordance with Equation (3.12). The 25-year return period shall be used to establish the design wind speed for each direction. Once these wind speeds are established for each increment, the highest wind speed shall be used to determine the mooring/berthing risk classification, from Table 31F-5-1. In order to simplify the</p>
<p>analysis for barges (or other small vessels), they may  perform a computer assisted mooring analysis.</p>
<p><b>3103F.5.2.2 Wind speed corrections.</b> Wind speed measured at an elevation of 33 feet (10 meters) above the water surface, with duration of 30 seconds shall be used to determine the design wind speed. If these conditions are not met, the following corrections shall be applied.</p>
<p>The correction for elevation is obtained from the equation:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_528_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>V<sub>w</sub> = wind speed at elevation 33 ft. (10 m.)</p>
<p>V<sub>h</sub> = wind speed at elevation h</p>
<p>h = elevation above water surface of wind data [feet]</p>
<p>The available wind duration shall be adjusted to a 30-second value, using the following formula:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_528_02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>V<sub>t=30sec</sub> = wind speed for a 30-second duration</p>
<p>V<sub>t</sub> = wind speed over a given duration</p>
<p>C<sub>t</sub> = conversion factor from Figure 31 F-3-3</p>
<p>If wind data is available over land only, the following equation shall be used to convert the wind speed from over-land to over-water conditions [3.10]:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_528_03.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>

<p>Alternatively, wind loads for any type of vessel may be calculated using the guidelines in Ferritto et al, 1999 </p>
<p><b>3103F.5.3 Current loads.</b> Environmental loads induced by currents at MOT<sub>s</sub> shall be calculated as specified in this subsection.</p>
<p><b>3103F.5.3.1 Design current velocity.</b> Maximum ebb and flood currents, annual river runoffs and controlled releases shall be considered when establishing the design current velocities for both existing and new MOT<sub>s</sub>.</p>
<p>Local current velocities may be obtained from NOAA  site-specific data, if the current velocity is higher than 1.5 knots.</p>
<p>Site-specific data shall be obtained by real time measurements over a one-year period. If this information is not available, a safety factor of 1.25 shall be applied to the best available data until real time measurements are obtained.</p>
<p>If the facility is not in operation during annual river runoffs and controlled releases, the current loads may be adjusted.</p>
<p>Operational dates need to be clearly stated in the definition of the terminal operating limits (see Section 3102F.3.6).</p>
<p><b>3103F.5.3.2 Current velocity adjustment factors.</b> An average current velocity (V<sub>c</sub>) shall be used to compute forces and moments. If the current velocity profile is known, the average current velocity can be obtained from the following equation:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_528_04.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>V<sub>c</sub> = average current velocity (knots)</p>
<p>T = draft of vessel</p>
<p>V<sub>c</sub> = current velocity as a function of depth (knots)</p>
<p>S = water depth measured from the surface</p>
<p>If the velocity profile is not known, the velocity at a known water depth should be adjusted by the factors provided in Figure 31F-3-4 to obtain the equivalent average velocity over the draft of the vessel.</p>
<p> procedures shall be used to determine current loads for moored tank vessels.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3103F.5.4 Wave loads.</b> When the significant wave period, T<sub>s</sub>, is greater than 4 seconds (See Section 3105F.3.1), the transverse wave induced vessel reactions shall be calculated using a simplified dynamic mooring analysis described below.</p>
<p>The horizontal water particle accelerations shall be calculated for the various wave conditions, taken at the mid-depth of the loaded vessel draft. The water particle accelerations shall then be used to calculate the wave excitation forces to determine the static displacement of the vessel. The Froude-Krylov method discussed in Chakrabarti’s  forces, by conservatively approximating the vessel as a rectangular box with dimensions similar to the actual</p>
<p>dimensions of the vessel. The horizontal water particle accelerations shall be calculated for the various wave conditions, taken at the mid-depth of the loaded vessel draft. The computed excitation force assumes a 90-degree incidence angle with the longitudinal axis of the vessel, which will result in forces that are significantly greater than the forces that will actually act upon the vessel from quartering seas. A load reduction factor may be used to account for the design wave incidence angle from the longitudinal axis of the ship. The overall excursion of the vessel shall be determined for each of the wave conditions by calculating the dynamic response of the linear spring mass system.</p>
<p><b>3103F.5.5 Passing vessels.</b> When required in Section 3105F.3, the sway and surge forces, as well as yaw moment, on a moored vessel, due to passing vessels, shall be established considering the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ratio of length of moored vessel to length of passing vessel.</li>
<li>Distance from moored vessel to passing vessel.</li>
<li>Ratio of midship section areas of the moored and passing vessels.</li>
<li>Underkeel clearances of the moored and passing vessels.</li>
<li>Draft and trim of the moored vessel and draft of the passing vessel.</li>
<li>Mooring line tensions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The passing vessel’s speed should take into consideration the ebb or flood current. Normal operating wind and current conditions can be assumed when calculating forces due </p>
<p><b>3103F.5.6 Seiche.</b> The penetration of long period low amplitude waves into a harbor can result in resonant standing wave systems, when the wave forcing frequency coincides with a natural frequency of the harbor. The resonant standing waves can result in large surge motions if this frequency is close to the natural frequency of the mooring system. Section 3105F.3.3 prescribes the procedure for the evaluation of these effects.</p>
<p><b>3103F.5.7 Tsunamis.</b> A tsunami may be generated by an earthquake or a subsea or coastal landslide, which may induce large wave heights and excessive currents. The large wave or surge and the excessive currents are potentially damaging, especially if there is a tank vessel moored </p>
<p>Tsunamis can be generated either by a distant or near source. A tsunami generated by a distant source (far field event) may allow operators to have an adequate warning for mitigating the risk by depart the MOT and go into deep water. For near-field events, with sources less than 500 miles away, </p>
<p>Recent tsunami studies have been completed for both Southern and Northern California. For the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, one of those recent studies focused on near field tsunamis with predicted return periods of 5,000 to 10,000 years [3.22]. These maximum water levels (run-up) would not normally be used for MOT design. However, because the study also provides actual tidal records from recent distant tsunamis, it should be used for design.</p>
<p>The run-up value for Port Hueneme was obtained from an earlier study by Synolakis et al. [3.23].</p>
<p>Run up-values: Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach =8ft.</p>
<p>Port Hueneme = 11 ft.</p>
<p>For the San Francisco Bay, a recent study provides the maximum credible tsunami water levels and current speeds. These results are deterministic and are based on the most severe seismic sources that could reasonably impact MOT<sub>s</sub> in the San Francisco Bay [3.24]. Table 31F-3-8 provides values for the marine oil terminal locations within San Francisco Bay. Water levels could be positive or negative and current velocities may vary in direction. In order to determine the maximum run-up at a MOT, the largest values should be added to the mean high tide. Further details are available in [3.24].</p>
<p>Loads from tsunami-induced waves can be calculated for  heights in shallow water and particle kinematics can also be obtained. Other structural considerations include uplift and debris impact.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3103F.6 Berthing Loads.</b></p>
<p><b>3103F.6.1 General.</b> Berthing loads are quantified in terms of transfer of kinetic energy of the vessel into potential energy dissipated by the fender(s). The terms and equations </p>
<p>Kinetic energy shall be calculated from the following equation:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_529_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>E<sub>vessel</sub> = Berthing energy of vessel [ft-lbs]</p>
<p>W = Total weight of vessel and cargo in pounds [long tons X 2240]</p>
<p>g = Acceleration due to gravity [32.2 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>]</p>
<p>V<sub>n</sub> = Berthing velocity normal to the berth [ft/sec]</p>
<p>The following correction factors shall be used to modify the actual energy to be absorbed by the fender system:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_530_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>E<sub>fender</sub> = Energy to be absorbed by the fender system</p>
<p>C<sub>b</sub> = Berthing Coefficient</p>
<p>C<sub>m</sub> = Effective mass or virtual mass coefficient (see Section 3103F.6.6)</p>
<p>The berthing coefficient, C<sub>b</sub>, is given by:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_530_02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>C<sub>e</sub> = Eccentricity Coefficient</p>
<p>C<sub>c</sub> = Configuration Coefficient</p>
<p>C<sub>g</sub> = Geometric Coefficient</p>
<p>C<sub>d</sub> = Deformation Coefficient</p>
<p>These coefficients are defined in Sections 3103F.6.2 through 3103F.6.5.</p>
<p>The approximate displacement of the vessel (when only partially loaded) at impact, DT, can be determined from an </p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_530_03.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>DWT = Dead Weight Tonnage (in long tons)</p>
<p>d<sub>actual</sub> = Actual arrival draft of the vessel</p>
<p>d<sub>max</sub> = Maximum loaded vessel draft</p>
<p>The berthing load shall be based on the fender reaction due to the kinetic berthing energy. The structural capacity shall be established based on allowable concrete, steel or timber properties in the structural components, as defined in Section 3107F.</p>
<p><b>3103F.6.2 Eccentricity coefficient (C<sub>e</sub>).</b> During the berthing maneuver, when the vessel is not parallel to the berthing line (usually the wharf face), not all the kinetic energy of the vessel will be transmitted to the fenders. Due to the reaction from the fender(s), the vessel will start to rotate around the contact point, thus dissipating part of its energy. Treating the vessel as a rigid rod of negligible width in the analysis of the energy impact on the fenders leads to the equation:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_530_04.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>k = Longitudinal radius of gyration of the vessel [ft]</p>
<p>a = Distance between the vessel's center of gravity and the point of contact on the vessel's side, projected onto the vessel's longitudinal axis [ft]</p>
<p><b>3103F.6.3 Geometric coefficient (C<sub>g</sub>).</b> The geometric coefficient, C<sub>g</sub>, depends upon the geometric configuration of the ship at the point of impact. It varies from 0.85 for an increasing convex curvature to 1.25 for concave curvature. Generally, 0.95 is recommended for the impact point at or beyond the quarter points of the ship, and 1.0 for broadside </p>
<p><b>3103F.6.4 Deformation coefficient (C<sub>d</sub>).</b> This accounts for the energy reduction effects due to local deformation of the ships hull and deflection of the whole ship along its longitudinal axis. The energy absorbed by the ship depends on the relative stiffness of the ship and the obstruction. The deformation coefficient varies from 0.9 for a nonresilient fender to nearly 1.0 for a flexible fender. For larger ships on energy-absorbing fender systems, little or no deformation of the ship takes place; therefore, a coefficient of 1.0 is recommended.</p>
<p><b>3103F.6.5 Configuration coefficient (C<sub>e</sub>).</b> This factor accounts for the difference between an open pier or wharf and a solid pier or wharf. In the first case, the movements of the water surrounding the berthing vessel is not (or is hardly) affected by the berth. In the second case, the water between the berthing vessel and the structure introduces a cushion effect that represents an extra force on the vessel away from the berth and reduces the energy to be absorbed by the fender system.</p>
<p>For open berth and corners of solid piers, C<sub>c</sub> = 1.0</p>
<p>For solid piers with parallel approach, C<sub>c</sub> = 0.8</p>
<p>For berths with different conditions, C<sub>c</sub> may be </p>
<p><b>3103F.6.6 Effective mass or virtual mass coefficient (C<sub>m</sub>).</b> In determining the kinetic energy of a berthing vessel, the effective or the virtual mass is the sum of vessel mass and hydrodynamic mass. The hydrodynamic mass does not necessarily vary with the mass of the vessel, but is closely related to the projected area of the vessel at right angles to the direction of motion.</p>
<p>Other factors, such as the form of vessel, water depth, berthing velocity, and acceleration or deceleration of the vessel, will have some effect on the hydrodynamic mass. Taking into account both model and prototype experiments, the effective or virtual mass coefficient can be estimated as:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_530_05.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>d<sub>actual</sub> = Actual arrival draft of the vessel</p>
<p>B = Beam of vessel</p>
<p>The value of C<sub>m</sub>for use in design should be a minimum of </p>
<p><b>3103F.6.7 Berthing velocity and angle.</b> The berthing velocity, V<sub>w</sub> is influenced by a large number of factors such as environmental conditions of the site (wind, current and wave),</p>
<p>method of berthing (with or without tugboat assistance), condition of the vessel during berthing (ballast or fully laden) and human factors (experience of the tugboat captain).</p>
<p>The berthing velocity, normal to berth, shall be in accordance with Table 31F-3-9, for existing berths. Site condition is determined from Table 31F-3-10. For new berths, the berthing velocity, V<sub>n</sub>, is established according to Table 4.2.1 </p>
<p>Subject to Division approval, if an existing MOT can demonstrate lower velocities by velocity monitoring equipment, then such a velocity may be used.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the normal berthing velocity, V<sub>n</sub>, an approach angle, defined as the angle formed by the fender line and the longitudinal axis of the vessel must be determined. The berthing angles, used to compute the normal berthing velocity, for various vessel sizes are shown in Table 31F-3-11.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3103F.7 Wind And current loads on structures.</b></p>
<p><b>3103F.7.1 General.</b> This section provides methods to determine the wind and current loads acting on the structure directly, as opposed to wind and current forces acting on the structure from a moored vessel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additional information about wind loads may be obtained </p>
<p><b>3103F.7.3 Current loads.</b> The current forces acting on the structure may be established using the current velocities, per Section 3103F.5.3.</p>
<p> of the structure shall be analyzed for all applicable load combinations given in Table 31F-3-12 or 31F-3-13, </p>
<p>The “ Vacant condition“ is the case wherein there is no vessel at the berth. The “ mooring and breasting condition“ exists after the vessel is securely tied to the wharf. The “ berthing condition” occurs as the vessel impacts the wharf, and the “earthquake condition” assumes no vessel is at the berth, and there is no wind or current forces on the structure.</p>
<p>The use of various load types is discussed below:</p>
<p><b>3103F.8.1 Dead load (D).</b> Upper and lower bound values of dead load are applied for the vacant condition to check the maximum moment and shear with minimum axial load.</p>
<p><b>3103F.8.2 Live load (L).</b> The live load on MOTs is typically small and is therefore neglected for combinations including earthquake loads.</p>
<p><b>3103F.8.3 Buoyancy load (B).</b> Buoyancy forces shall be considered for any submerged or immersed substructures (including pipelines, sumps and structural components).</p>
<p><b>3103F.8.4 Wind (W) and current (C) on the structure.</b> Wind and currents on the vessel are included in the mooring and breasting condition. The wind and current loads acting on the structure are therefore additional loads that can act simultaneously with the mooring, breasting and/or berthing loads.</p>
<p><b>3103F.8.5 Earth pressure on the structure (H).</b> The soil pressure on end walls, typically concrete cut-off walls, steel sheep pile walls on wharf type structures and/or piles shall be considered.</p>
<p><b>3103F.8.6 Mooring line/breasting loads (M).</b> Mooring line and breasting loads can occur simultaneously or individually, depending on the combination of wind and current. Multiple load cases for operating and survival conditions may be required (see Sections 3103F.5.2 and 3105F.2). In addition, loads caused by passing vessels shall be considered for the “mooring and breasting condition.” Refer to Sections 3105F.2 and 3105F.3 for the determination of mooring line and breasting loads.</p>
<p><b>3103F.8.7 Berthing load (B<sub>e</sub>).</b> Berthing is a frequent occurrence, and shall be considered as a normal operating load. No increase in allowable stresses shall be applied for ASD, and a load factor of 1.7 shall be applied for the LRFD approach.</p>
<p><b>3103F.8.8 Earthquake loads (E).</b> In LRFD or performance based design, use a load factor of 1.0; for ASD use 0.7.A loadfactor of 1.0 shall be assigned to the earthquake loads. Performance based seismic analysis methodology requires that the actual force demand be limited to defined strains in concrete, steel and timber. For the deck and pile evaluation, two cases of dead load (upper and lower bound) shall be considered in combination with the seismic load.</p>
<p><b>3103F.9 Safety factors for mooring lines.</b> Safety factors for different material types of mooring lines are given in Table 31F-3-14. The safety factors should be applied to the minimum number of lines specified by the mooring analysis, using the highest loads calculated for the environmental conditions. The minimum breaking load (mbl) of new ropes is obtained from the certificate issued by the manufacturer. If nylon tails are used in combination with steel wire ropes, the safety factor shall be based on the weaker of the two ropes.</p>
<p><b>3103F.10 Mooring hardware.</b> Marine hardware consists of quick release hooks, other mooring fittings and base bolts. The certificate issued by the manufacturer normally defines the allowable working loads of this hardware.</p>
<p> required for each breasting line location for tankers larger than 50,000 DWT. At least two hooks at each location shall be provided for breasting lines for tankers less than 50,000 DWT.</p>
<p>All hooks and supporting structures shall withstand the minimum breaking load (MBL) of the strongest line with a safety factor of 1.2 or greater. Only one mooring line shall be placed on each quick release hook.</p>
<p>For multiple quick release hooks, the minimum horizontal load for the design of the tie-down shall be:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_533_01.jpg"/></p>
<p>F<sub>d</sub> = Minimum factored demand for assembly tie-down.</p>
<p>n = Number of hooks on the assembly.</p>
<p>The capacity of the supporting structures must be larger than F<sub>d</sub>(See Section 3107F.4.3).</p>
<p><b>3103F.10.2 Other Fittings.</b> Other fittings include cleats, bitts and bollards.</p>
<p>If the allowable working loads for existing fittings are not available, the values listed in Table 31F-3-15 may be used for typical sizes, bolt patterns and layout. The allowable working loads are defined for mooring line angles up to 60 degrees from the horizontal. The combination of vertical and horizontal loads must be considered.</p>
<p><b>3103F.10.3 Base bolts.</b> Base bolts are subjected to both shear and uplift. Forces on bolts shall be determined using the following factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Height of load application on bitts or bollards.</li>
<li>Actual vertical angles of mooring lines for the highest and lowest tide and vessel draft conditions, for all sizes of vessels at each particular berth.</li>
<li>Actual horizontal angles from the mooring line configurations, for all vessel sizes and positions at each particular berth.</li>
<li>Simultaneous loads from more than one vessel.</li>
</ol>
<p>For existing MOTs, the deteriorated condition of the base bolts and supporting members shall be considered in determining the capacity of the fitting.</p>
<p><b>3103F.11 Miscellaneous loads.</b> Handrails and guardrails shall be designed for 25 plf with a 200-pound minimum concentrated load in any location or direction.</p>

<h3>SECTION 3104F SEISMIC ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE</h3>
<p class="b"><b>3104F.1 General.</b></p>
<p><b>3104F.1.1 Purpose.</b> The purpose of this section is to establish minimum standards for seismic analysis and structural performance. Seismic performance is evaluated at two criteria levels. Level 1 requirements define a performance criterion to ensure MOT functionality. Level 2 requirements safeguard against major structural damage or collapse.</p>
<p><b>3104F.1.2 Applicability.</b> Section 3104F applies to all new and existing MOTs structures. Structures supporting loading arms, pipelines, oil transfer and storage equipment, critical nonstructural systems and vessel mooring structures, such as mooring and breasting dolphins are included. Catwalks and similar components that are not part of the lateral load carrying system and do not support oil transfer equipment may be excluded.</p>
<p><b>3104F.1.3 Oil spill risk classification.</b> Each existing MOT shall be catagorized into one of three risk classifications (high, medium or low) as shown in Table 31F-4-1, based on the highest of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exposed total volume of oil during transfer (“total volume” as calculated in Section 3108F.2.3)</li>
<li>Number of oil transfer operations per berthing system per year</li>
<li>Maximum vessel size (DWT) that may call at the berthing system</li>
</ol>
<p>If risk reduction strategies (see Section 3101F.5) are adopted such that the maximum volume of exposed oil during transfer is less than 1,200 barrels, the classification level of the facility may be lowered. All new MOTs are classified as high risk.</p>
<p><b>3104F.1.4 Configuration classification.</b> Each MOT shall be designated as regular or irregular, in accordance with Figure 31F-4-1.</p>
<p>Irregular configurations, such as the “T” layout, may be analyzed as regular if the presence of expansion joints divides the T-configuration into two or more regular segments. Expansion joints in this context are defined as joints that separate each structural segment in such a manner that each segment will move independently during an earthquake.</p>
<p>If an irregular MOT is divided into seismically isolated sections, an evaluation of the relative movement of pipelines</p>
<p>and supports shall be considered, including phase differences (Section 3109F.3).</p>
<p class="b"><b>3104F.2 Existing MOTs</b></p>
<p><b>3104F.2.1 Design earthquake motions.</b> Two levels of design seismic performance shall be considered. These levels are defined as follows:</p>
<p class="b"><b>Level 1 Seismic performance:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Minor or no structural damage</li>
<li>Temporary or no interruption in operations</li>
</ul>
<p class="b"><b>Level 2 Seismic performance:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Controlled inelastic structural behavior with repairable damage</li>
<li>Prevention of structural collapse</li>
<li>Temporary loss of operations, restorable within months</li>
<li>Prevention of major spill (≥ 1200 bbls)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3104F.2.2 Basis for evaluation.</b> Component capacities shall be based on existing conditions, calculated as “best estimates,” taking into account the mean material strengths, strain hardening and degradation overtime. The capacity of components with little or no ductility, which may lead to brittle failure scenarios, shall be calculated based on lower bound material strengths. Methods to establish component strength and deformation capacities for typical structural</p>
<p>materials and components are provided in Section 3107F. Geotechnical considerations are discussed in Section 3106F.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3 Analytical procedures.</b> The objective of the seismic analysis is to verify that the displacement capacity of the structure is greater than the displacement demand, for each performance level defined in Table 31F-4-2. The required analytical procedures are summarized in Table 31F-4-3.</p>
<p>The displacement capacity of the structure shall be calculated using the nonlinear static (pushover) procedure. It is also acceptable to use a nonlinear dynamic procedure for capacity evaluation. Methods used to calculate the displacement demand are linear modal, nonlinear static and nonlinear dynamic.</p>
<p>Any rational method, subject to the division's approval, can be used in lieu of the required analytical procedures shown in Table 31F-4-3.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.1 Nonlinear static capacity procedure (push over).</b> Two-dimensional nonlinear static (pushover) analyses shall be performed; three-dimensional analyses are optional. A model that incorporates the nonlinear load deformation characteristics of all components for the lateral force-resisting system shall be displaced to a target displacement to determine the internal deformations and forces. The target displacement depends on the seismic performance level under consideration. Modeling details are as follows:</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.1.1 Modeling.</b> A series of nonlinear push-over analyses may be required depending on the complexity of the MOT structure. At a minimum, pushover analysis of a two-dimensional model shall be conducted in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. The piles shall be represented by nonlinear elements that capture the moment-curvature/rotation relationship for components with expected inelastic behavior in accordance with Section 3107F. A nonlinear element is not required to represent each pile location. Piles with similar lateral force-deflection behavior may be lumped in fewer larger springs, provided that the overall torsional effects are captured.</p>
<p>Linear material component behavior is acceptable where nonlinear response will not occur. All components shall be based on effective moment of inertia calculated in accordance with Section 3107F. Specific requirements for timber pile structures are discussed in the next section.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.1.2 Timber pile supported structures.</b> For all timber pile supported structures, linear elastic procedures may be used. Alternatively, the nonlinear static procedure may be used to estimate the target displacement demand, Δ<sub>d</sub></p>
<p>A simplified single pile model for a typical timber pile supported structure is shown in Figure 31F-4-2. The pile-deck connections may be assumed to be “pinned.” The lateral bracing can often be ignored if it is in poor condition. These assumptions shall be used for the analysis, unless a detailed condition assessment and lateral analysis indicate that the existing bracing and connections may provide reliable lateral resistance.</p>
<p>A series of single pile analyses may be sufficient to establish the nonlinear springs required for the push-over analysis.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.1.3 Soil-structure interaction (SSI).</b> Load-deformation characteristics for foundations shall be modeled as per Section 3106F.5. Selection of soil springs shall be based on the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Effect of the large difference in up and down slope stiffnesses for wharf type structures</li>
<li>Effect of upper and lower bound soil parameters, especially for t-z curves used to model batter pile behavior</li>
</ol>
<p>A separate analysis that captures the demand (Section 3104F.2.3.2) on the piles due to permanent ground deformations, at embankments only, shall be performed.</p>
<p>If a simplified methodology is followed, the piles need to be checked for the following load combinations:</p>
<p>1.0E<sub>intertial</sub></p>
<p>1.0H<sub>d</sub> + 0.25E<sub>intertial</sub></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>E<sub>inertial</sub> = Inertial seismic load</p>
<p>H<sub>d</sub> = Foundation deformation load</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.2 Nonlinear static demand procedure.</b> A nonlinear static procedure shall be used to determine the  describe the procedure of Priestly et al. [4.1]; an alternate procedure is presented in ATC 40 [4.2], which is improved in <a class="cite" href="sibr/gov.fema.fema440.pdf">FEMA 440</a> [4.3]. A linear modal procedure is required for irregular structures with high or moderate seismic risk classifications, and may be used for all other classifications in lieu of the nonlinear static procedure.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.2.1 Lateral stiffness.</b> The lateral stiffness, k, is calculated from the force-displacement relation as the total base shear, V<sub>y</sub> corresponding to the yield displacement of the structure Δ<sub>y</sub>Δy is the displacement at first yield in the pile/deck connection reinforcement.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.2.2 Structural period.</b> The fundamental period, T, of the structure in the direction under consideration shall be calculated as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_538_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>m = mass of structure in kips/g</p>
<p>k = stiffness in direction under consideration in kips/ft</p>
<p>g = gravity, 32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup> (9.8 meters/sec<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.2.3 Target displacement demand.</b> The target displacement demand of the structure, Δd, can be calculated by multiplying the spectral response acceleration, S<sub>A</sub> corresponding to the period, T, by T<sup>2</sup>/4π<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_538_02.jpg"/></p>
<p>If T &lt; T<sub>0</sub>, where T<sub>0</sub> is the period corresponding to the peak of the acceleration response spectrum, a refined analysis (see Section 3104F.2.3.2.5) shall be used to calculate the displacement demand. Multidirectional excitation shall be addressed per Section 3104F.4.2.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.2.4 Damping.</b> The displacement demand established in Section 3104F.2.3.2.3 is based on 5 percent damping. Higher damping values obtained from a refined analysis may be used to calculated the displacement demand.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.2.5 Refined analyses.</b> Refined displacement demand analyses may be calculated as per Chapters 4 and 5 of [4.1] and is briefly summarized below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine Δ<sub>d</sub>, from Section 3104F.2.3.2.3.</li>
<li>From the nonlinear pushover analysis, determine the structural yield displacement Δ<sub>y</sub>.</li>
<li>The ductility level, µ<sub>Δ</sub>, is found from Δ<sub>d</sub>/Δ<sub>y</sub>. Use the appropriate relationship between ductility and damping, for the component undergoing inelastic deformation, to estimate the effective structural damping, ξ<sub>eff</sub> In lieu of more detailed analysis, the relationship shown in Figure 31F-4-3 or equation (4-3) may be used for concrete and steel piles connected to the deck through dowels embedded in the concrete.

</li>
<li>From the acceleration response spectra, create elastic displacement spectra, S<sub>D</sub> using equation (4-4) for various levels of damping.

</li>
<li>Using the curve applicable to the effective structural damping, ξ, find the effective period, T<sub>d</sub> (see Figure 31F-4-4).</li>
<li>In order to convert from a design displacement response spectra to another spectra for a different damping level, the adjustment factors in Section 3103F.4.2.9 shall be used.</li>
<li>The effective stiffness k<sub>e</sub> can then be found from:

<li>The required strength F<sub>w</sub> can now be estimated by:
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_539_04.jpg"/></p></li>
<li>F<sub>u</sub> and Δ<sub>d</sub> can be plotted on the force-displacement curve established by the pushover analysis. Since this is an iterative process, the intersection of F<sub>u</sub> and Δ<sub>d</sub> most likely will not fall on the force-displacement curve and a second iteration will be required. An adjusted value of Δ<sub>d</sub> taken as the intersection between the force-displacement curve and a line between the origin and F<sub>u</sub> and Δ<sub>d</sub> can be used to find μ<sub>Δ.</sub></li>
<li>Repeat the process until a satisfactory solution is obtained (see Figure 31F-4-5).

<p><b>FIGURE 31F-4-5 EFFECTIVE STIFFNESS, k e [4.1]</b></p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.3 Linear modal demand procedure.</b> For irregular concrete/steel structures with moderate or high risk classifications, a linear analysis is required to predict the global displacement demands. A 3-D linear elastic response analysis shall be used, with effective moment of inertia applied to components to establish lateral displacement demands.</p>
<p>Sufficient modes shall be included in the analysis such that 90 percent of the participating mass is captured in each of the principal horizontal directions for the structure. For modal combinations, the complete quadratic combination rule shall be used. Multidirectional excitation shall be accounted for in accordance with Section 3104F.4.2.</p>
<p>The lateral stiffness of the linear elastic response model shall be based on the initial stiffness of the nonlinear pushover curve as shown in Figure 31F-4-6 (also see Section 3106F.5.1). The p-y springs shall be adjusted based on the secant method approach. Most of the p-y springs will typically be based on their initial stiffness; no iteration is required.</p>
<p>If the fundamental period in the direction under consideration is less than T<sub>0</sub> as defined in Section 3104F.2.3.2.3, then the displacement demand shall be amplified as specified in Section 3104F.2.3.2.5.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.4 Nonlinear dynamic analysis.</b> Nonlinear dynamic time history analysis is optional, and if performed, a peer review is required (see Section 3101F.6.1). Multiple acceleration records shall be used, as explained in Section 3103F.4.2.10. The following assumptions may be made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Equivalent “super piles” can represent groups of piles.</li>
<li>If the deck has sufficient rigidity (both in-plane and out-of plane) to justify its approximation as a rigid element, a 2-D plan simulation may be adequate.</li>
</ol>
<p>A time-history analysis should always be compared with a simplified approach to ensure that results are reasonable. Displacements calculated from the nonlinear time history analyses may be used directly in design, but shall not be less than 80 percent of the values obtained from Section 3104F.2.3.2.</p>
<p><b>3104F.2.3.5 Alternative procedures.</b> Alternative lateral-force procedures using rational analyses based on well-established principles of mechanics may be used in lieu of those prescribed in these provisions. As per Section 3101F.6.1, peer review is required.</p>
<p><b>3104F.3 New MOTs.</b> The analysis and design requirements described in Section 3104F.2 shall also apply to new MOTs. Additional requirements are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Site-specific response spectra analysis (see Section 3103F.4.2.3).</li>
<li>Soil parameters based on site-specific and new borings (see Section 3106F.2.2).</li>
</ol>
<p class="b"><b>3104F.4 General analysis and design requirements.</b></p>
<p><b>3104F.4.1 Load combinations.</b> Earthquake loads shall be used in the load combinations described in Section 3103F.8.</p>
<p><b>3104F.4.2 Combination of orthogonal effects.</b> The design displacement demand, Δ<sub>d</sub> shall be calculated by combining the longitudinal, Δ<sub>x</sub> and transverse, Δ<sub>y</sub> displacements in the horizontal plane (Figure 31F-4-7):</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_540_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_540_02.jpg"/></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_540_04.jpg"/></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_540_05.jpg"/></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_540_06.jpg"/></p>
<p>whichever results in the greater design displacement demand.</p>
<p>In lieu of combining the displacement demands as presented above, the design displacement demand for marginal wharf type MOTs may be calculated as:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_540_07.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>Δ<sub>y</sub> = transverse displacement demand</p>
<p>e = eccentricity between center of mass and center of rigidity</p>
<p>L<sub>1</sub> = longitudinal length between wharf expansion</p>
<p>This equation is only valid for wharf aspect ratios (length/breadth) greater than 3.</p>
<p><b>3104F.4.3 P-Δ Effects.</b> The P-Δ effect (i.e., the additional moment induced by the total vertical load multiplied by the lateral deck deflection) shall be considered unless the following relationship is satisfied (see Figure 31F-4-8):</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_540_08.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>V = base shear strength of the structure obtained from a plastic analysis</p>
<p>W = dead load of the frame</p>
<p>Δ<sub>d</sub> = displacement demand</p>
<p>H = distance from the location of maximum in-ground moment to center of gravity of the deck</p>
<p>For wharf structures where the lateral displacement is limited by almost fully embedded piles, P-Δ effects may be ignored; however, the individual stability of the piles shall be checked in accordance with Section 3107F.2.5.2.</p>
<p>If the landside batter piles are allowed to fail in a Level 2 evaluation, the remaining portion of the wharf shall be checked for P-Δ effects.</p>
<p><b>3104F.4.4 Expansion joints.</b> The effect of expansion joints shall be considered in the seismic analysis.</p>
<p><b>3104F.4.5 Shear key forces.</b> Shear force across shear keys connecting adjacent wharf segments, V<sub>sk’</sub> (approximate  as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_541_02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>V<sub>ΔT</sub> = total segment lateral force found from a push-over analysis</p>
<p>L<sub>l</sub> = segment length</p>
<p>e = eccentricity between the center of rigidity and the center of mass</p>
<p><b>3104F.4.6 Connections.</b> For an existing wharf, the deteriorated conditions at the junction between the pile top and pile cap shall be considered in evaluating the moment capacity. Connection detail between the vertical pile and pile cap shall be evaluated to determine whether full or partial moment capacity can be developed under seismic action.</p>
<p>For new MOTs, the connection details shall develop the full moment capacities.</p>
<p>The modeling shall simulate the actual moment capacity (full or partial) of the joint in accordance with Section 3107F.2.7.</p>
<p><b>3104F.4.7 Batter piles.</b> Batter piles primarily respond to earthquakes by developing large axial compression or tension forces. Bending moments are generally of secondary importance. Failure in compression may be dictated by the deck-pile connection (most common type), material compression, buckling, or by excessive local shear in deck members adjacent to the batter pile. Failure in tension may be dictated by connection strength or by pile pull out. (p. 3-83 </p>
<p>When the controlling failure scenario is reached and the batter pile fails, the computer model shall be adjusted to consist of only the vertical pile acting either as a full or partial moment frame based on the connection details between the pile top and pile cap. The remaining displacement capacity, involving vertical piles, before the secondary failure stage develops, shall then be established (see Section 3107F.2.8).</p>
<p>Axial p-z curves shall be modeled. In compression, displacement capacity should consider the effect of the reduction in pile modulus of elasticity at high loads and the increase in effective length for friction piles. This procedure allows the pile to deform axially before reaching ultimate loads, thereby increasing the displacement ductility </p>
<p>Horizontal nonlinear p-y springs are only applied to batter piles with significant embedment, such as for landside batter piles in a wharf structure. Moment fixity can be assumed for batter piles that extend well above the ground such as waterside batter piles in a wharf structure or batter piles in a pier type structure.</p>
<p><b>3104F.5 Nonstructural components.</b> Nonstructural components including, but not limited to pipelines, loading arms, raised platforms, control rooms and vapor control equipment may affect the global structural response. In such cases, the seismic characteristics (mass and/or stiffness) of the nonstructural components shall be considered in the structural analysis.</p>
<p><b>3104F.5.1 Mass contribution.</b> The weight of permanently attached nonstructural components shall be included in the dead load of the structure, per Section 3103F.2. An exception is an MOT pipeline that is allowed to slide between anchor points and hence the pipeline response is typically out of phase with the structural response. Thus, the pipeline may be subjected to a different acceleration than the substructure, even if the pipeline cannot slide between anchor points. In such cases, the pipeline mass shall not be included directly in the seismic mass of the structure.</p>
<p><b>3104F.5.2 Seismic loads.</b> In general, for nonstructural components, the evaluation procedures of Section 3110F.8 are adequate.</p>
<p>For pipelines, the seismic analysis shall be performed in accordance with Section 3109F.3, in lieu of Section 3110F.8. If an analysis has been performed and support reactions are available, they may be used to determine the forces on the support structure.</p>
<p> A pipeline segment under consideration shall extend between two adjacent anchor points. A simplified pipeline analysis may be used when the relative displacement demands of anchor points are considered. As an option, a full nonlinear time-history analysis can be used to capture the nonlinear interaction between the structure and the pipeline.</p>
<p><b>3104F.6 Nonstructural critical systems assesment.</b> A seismic assessment of the survivability and continued operation during a Level 2 earthquake (see Table 31F-4-2) shall be performed for critical systems such as fire protection, emergency shutdown and electrical power systems. The assessment shall consider the adequacy and condition of anchorage, flexibility and seismically-induced interaction. The results shall be included in the Audit.</p>

<h3>SECTION 3105F MOORING AND BERTHING ANALYSIS AND DESIGN</h3>
<p class="b"><b>3105F.1 General.</b></p>
<p><b>3105F.1.1 Purpose.</b> This section establishes minimum standards for safe mooring and berthing of vessels at MOTs.</p>
<p><b>3105F.1.2 Applicability.</b> This section applies to onshore MOTs; Figure 31F-5-1 shows typical pier and wharf configurations.</p>
<p><b>3105F.1.3 Mooring/berthing risk classification.</b> Each MOT shall be assigned a mooring/berthing risk classification of high, medium or low, as determined from Table 31F-5-1, based on the following site-specific parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wind</li>
<li>Current</li>
<li>Hydrodynamic effects of passing vessels</li>
<li>Change in vessel draft</li>
</ol>
<p>Exceedance of any of the defined condition thresholds in Table 31F-5-1 places the MOT in the appropriate mooring/berthing risk classification.</p>
<p>The maximum wind, V<sub>w</sub>, (corrected for duration, height and over water) and maximum current, V<sub>c</sub>, shall be obtained (see Section 3103F.5).</p>
<p>In order to determine if there are significant potential passing vessel effects on moored vessels at an MOT, see Section 3105F.3.2.</p>
<p>The range of vessel draft shall be based on the local tidal variation and the operational limits of the vessels berthing at the MOT.</p>
<p>Multiple berth MOTs shall use the same conditions for each berth unless it can be demonstrated that there are significant differences.</p>
<p>MOTs with high mooring/berthing risk classifications (Table 31F-5-1) shall have the following equipment in operation: an anemometer (N/E), a current meter (N/E) (may be omitted if safety factor according to Section 3103F.5.3.1 is applied to current) and remote reading tension load devices (N).</p>
<p><b>3105F.1.4 New MOTs.</b> Quick release hooks are required at all new MOTs, except for spring line fittings. Quick release hooks shall be sized, within normal allowable stresses, for the safe working load of the largest size mooring line and configuration. To avoid accidental release, the freeing mechanism shall be activated by a two-step process. Quick release hooks shall be insulated electrically from the mooring structure, and should be supported so as not to contact the deck.</p>
<p><b>3105F.1.5 Analysis and design of mooring components.</b> The existing condition of the MOT shall be used in the mooring analysis (see Section 3102F). Structural characteristics of the MOT, including type and configuration of mooring fittings such as bollards, bitts, hooks and capstans and material properties and condition, shall be determined in accordance with Sections 3107F.4 and 3103F.10.</p>
<p>The analysis and design of mooring components shall be based on the loading combinations and safety factors defined in Section 3103F.8 through 3103F.10, and in  </p>
<p><b>3105F.2 Mooring analyses.</b> A mooring analysis shall be performed for each berthing system, to justify the safe berthing of the various deadweight capacities of vessels expected at the MOT. The forces acting on a moored vessel shall be determined in accordance with Section 3103F.5. Mooring line and breasting load combinations shall be in accordance with Section 3103F.8.</p>
<p>Two procedures, manual and numerical are available for performing mooring analyses. These procedures shall conform to either the OCIMF documents, “Mooring Equipment Guidelines” [5.4] and “Prediction of Wind and Current Loads on VLCCs” [5.5] or the Department of Defense “Moorings”  be used for barges.</p>
<p>A new mooring assessment shall be performed when conditions change, such as any modification in the mooring configuration, vessel size or new information indicating greater wind, current or other environmental loads.</p>
<p>In general, vessels shall remain in contact with the breasting or fendering system. Vessel motion (sway) of up to 2 feet off the breasting structure may be allowed under the most severe environmental loads, unless greater movement can be justified by an appropriate mooring analysis that accounts for potential dynamic effects. The allowable movement shall be consistent with mooring analysis results, indicating that forces in the mooring lines and their supports are within the allowable safety factors. Also, a check shall be made as to whether the movement is within the limitations of the cargo transfer equipment.</p>
<p>The most severe combination of the environmental loads has to be identified for each mooring component. At a minimum, the following conditions shall be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two current directions (maximum ebb and flood; See Section 3103F.5.3)</li>
<li>Two tide levels (highest high and lowest low)</li>
<li>Two vessel loading conditions (ballast and maximum draft at the terminal)</li>
<li>Eight wind directions (45 degree increments)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>3105F.2.1 Manual procedure.</b> For MOTs classified as Low risk (Table 31F-5-1), simplified calculations may be used to determine the mooring forces, except if any of the following conditions exist (Figures 31F-5-2 and 31F-5-3, below).</p>
<ol>
<li>Mooring layout is significantly asymmetrical</li>
<li>Horizontal mooring line angles (α) on bow and stern exceed 45 degrees</li>
<li>Horizontal breast mooring line angles exceed 15 normal to the hull</li>
<li>Horizontal spring mooring line angles exceed 10 degrees from a line parallel to the hull <img alt="FIGURE 31 F-5-2 HORIZONTAL LINE ANGLES [5.4]" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_544_01.jpg" style="width: 3in;"/> <b>FIGURE 31 F-5-2 HORIZONTAL LINE ANGLES [5.4]</b> <img alt="FIGURE 31F-5-3 VERTICAL LINE ANGLES [5.4]" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_544_02.jpg" style="width: 3in;"/> <b>FIGURE 31 F-5-3 VERTICAL LINE ANGLES [5.4]</b></li>
<li>Vertical mooring line angles (θ) exceed 25 degrees</li>
<li>Mooring lines for lateral loads not grouped at bow and stern</li>
</ol>
<p>When the forces have been determined and the distance between the bow and stern mooring points is known, the yaw moment can be resolved into lateral loads at the bow and stern. The total environmental loads on a moored vessel are comprised of the lateral load at the vessel bow, the lateral load at the vessel stern and the longitudinal load. Line pretension loads must be added.</p>
<p>Four load cases shall be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Entire load is taken by mooring lines</li>
<li>Entire load is taken by breasting structures</li>
<li>Load is taken by combination of mooring lines and breasting structures</li>
<li>Longitudinal load is taken only by spring lines</li>
</ol>
<p><b>3105F.2.2 Numerical procedure.</b> A numerical procedure is required to obtain mooring forces for MOTs classified as Medium or High (See Table 31 F-5-1) and for those that do not satisfy the requirements for using simplified calculations. Computer program(s) shall be based on mooring analysis procedures that consider the characteristics of the mooring system, calculate the environmental loads and provide resulting mooring line forces and vessel motions (surge and sway).</p>
<p class="b"><b>3105F.3 Wave, passing vessel, seiche and tsunami.</b></p>
<p><b>3105F.3.1 Wind waves.</b> MOTs are generally located in sheltered waters such that typical wind waves can be assumed not to affect the moored vessel if the significant wave period, T<sub>s</sub>, is less than 4 seconds. However, if the period is equal to or greater than 4 seconds, than a simplified dynamic analysis (See Section 3103F.5.4) is required. The wave period shall be established based on a 1-year significant wave height, H<sub>s</sub> For MOTs within a harbor basin, the wave period shall be based on the locally generated waves with relatively short fetch.</p>
<p><b>3105F.3.2 Passing vessels.</b> These forces generated by passing vessels are due to pressure gradients associated with the flow pattern. These pressure gradients cause the moored vessel to sway, surge, and yaw, thus imposing forces on the mooring lines.</p>
<p>Passing vessel analysis shall be conducted when all of the following conditions exist (See Figure 31F-5-4):</p>
<ol>
<li>Passing vessel size is greater than 25,000 dwt.</li>
<li>Distance L is 500 feet or less</li>
<li>Vessel speed V is greater than V<sub>crit</sub></li>
</ol>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_544_03.jpg"/></p>
<p><b>Exception:</b> If L ≤ 2B, passing vessel loads shall be considered.</p>
<p>L and B are shown in Figure 31F-5-4, in units of feet. V is defined as the speed of vessel over land minus the current velocity, when traveling with the current, or the speed of vessel over land plus the current velocity, when traveling against the current.</p>
<p>When such conditions (1,2 and 3 above) exist, the surge and sway forces and the yaw moment acting on the moored vessel shall, as a minimum, be established in accordance with Section 3103F.5.5. If the demands from such evaluation are greater than 75 percent of the mooring system capacity (breaking strength of mooring lines), then a more sophisticated dynamic analysis is required.</p>
<p>For MOTs located in ports, the passing distance, L, may  when establishing the distance, “L.”</p>
<p>For MOTs, not located within a port, the distance, “L,” must be determined from observed traffic patterns.</p>
<p>The following passing vessel positions shall be investigated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Passing vessel is centered on the moored ship. This position produces maximum sway force.</li>
<li>The midship of the passing vessel is fore or aft of the centerline of the moored ship by a distance of 0.40 times the length of the moored ship. This position is assumed to produce maximum surge force and yaw moment at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mooring loads due to a passing vessel shall be added to the mooring loads due to wind and current.</p>
<p><b>3105F.3.3 Seiche.</b> A seiche analysis is required for existing MOTs located within a harbor basin and which have historically experienced seiche. A seiche analysis is required for new MOTs inside a harbor basin prone to penetration of ocean waves.</p>
<p>The standing wave system or seiche is characterized by a series of “nodes” and “antinodes.” Seiche typically has wave periods ranging from 20 seconds up to several hours, with wave heights in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 ft [5.7].</p>
<p>The following procedure may be used, as a minimum, in evaluating the effects of seiche within a harbor basin. In more complex cases where the assumptions below are not applicable, dynamic methods are required.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the natural period of oscillation of the basin. The basin may be idealized as rectangular,  length for different modes. The first three modes shall be considered in the analysis.</li>
<li>Determine the location of the moored ship with respect to the antinode and node of the first three modes to determine the possibility of resonance.</li>
<li>Determine the natural period of the vessel and mooring system. The calculation shall be based on the total mass of the system and the stiffness of the mooring lines in surge. The surge motion of the moored vessel is estimated by analyzing the vessel motion as a harmonically forced linear single degree of freedom spring mass system. Methods outlined in a paper by F.A. Kilner [5.8] can be used to calculate the vessel motion.</li>
<li>Vessels are generally berthed parallel to the channel; therefore, only longitudinal (surge) motions shall be considered, with the associated mooring loads in the spring lines. The loads on the mooring lines (spring lines) are then determined from the computed vessel motion and the stiffness of those mooring lines.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>3105F.3.4 Tsunami.</b> Run-up and current velocity shall be considered in the tsunami assessment. Table 31F-3-8 provides run-up values for the San Francisco Bay area, Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbors and Port Hueneme.</p>
<p><b>3105F.4 Berthing analysis and design.</b> In general and for new MOTs, the fender system alone shall be designed to absorb the berthing energy. For existing MOTs, the berthing analysis may include the fender and structure.</p>
<p>The analysis and design of berthing components shall be based on the loading combinations and safety factors defined in Sections 3103F.8 and 3103F.9 and in accordance with ACI </p>
<p><b>3105F.4.1 Berthing energy demand.</b> The kinetic berthing energy demand shall be determined in accordance with Section 3103F.6.</p>
<p><b>3105F.4.2 Berthing energy capacity.</b> For existing MOTs, the berthing energy capacity shall be calculated as the area under the force-deflection curve for the combined structure and fender system as indicated in Figure 31F-5-5. Fender piles may be included in the lateral analysis to establish the total force-deflection curve for the berthing system. Load-deflection curves for other fender types shall be obtained from manufacturer”s data. The condition of fenders shall be taken into account when performing the analysis.</p>
<p>When batter piles are present, the fender system typically absorbs most of the berthing energy. This can be established by comparing the force-deflection curves for the fender system and batter piles. In this case only the fender system energy absorption shall be considered.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3105F.4.3 Tanker contact length.</b></p>
<p><b>3105F.4.3.1 Continuous fender system.</b> A continuous fender system consists of fender piles, chocks, wales, and rubber or spring fender units.</p>
<p>The contact length of a ship during berthing depends on the spacing of the fender piles and fender units, and the connection details of the chocks and wales to the fender piles.</p>
<p>The contact length, L<sub>c</sub> can be approximated by the chord formed by the curvature of the bow and the berthing angle as shown in Equation 5-2 below.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_546_02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>L<sub>c</sub> = contact length</p>
<p>r = Bow radius</p>
<p>α = Berthing Angle</p>
<p>In lieu of detailed analysis to determine the contact length, Table 31F-5-2 may be used. The contact length for a vessel within the range listed in the table can be obtained by interpolation.</p>
<p><b>3105F.4.3.2 Discrete fender system.</b> For discrete fender systems (i.e., not continuous), one fender unit or breasting dolphin shall be able to absorb the entire berthing energy.</p>
<p><b>3105F.4.4 Longitudinal and vertical berthing forces.</b> The longitudinal and vertical components of the horizontal berthing force shall be calculated using appropriate coefficients of friction between the vessel and the fender. In lieu of as-built data, the values in Table 31F-5-3 may be used for typical fender/vessel materials:</p>
<p>Longitudinal and vertical forces shall be determined by:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_546_03.jpg"/></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>F = longitudinal or vertical component of horizontal berthing force</p>
<p>&amp;mu = coefficient of friction of contact materials</p>
<p>N = maximum horizontal berthing force (normal to fender)</p>
<p><b>3105F.4.5 Design and selection of new fender systems.</b> For   [5.9] and the PIANC Guidelines for the Design of Fenders Systems: 2002 [5.10].</p>
<p><b>3105F.5 Layout of new MOTs.</b> The number and spacing of independent mooring dolphins and breasting dolphins depends on the DWT and length overall (LOA) of vessels to be accommodated.</p>
<p>Breasting dolphins shall be positioned adjacent to the parallel body of the vessel when berthed. A minimum of two breasting dolphins shall be provided. The spacing of breasting dolphins shall be adequate for all sizes of vessels that may berth at the MOT.</p>
<p>Mooring dolphins shall be set back from the berthing line (fender line) for a distance between 115 ft and 165 ft, so that longer bow, stern and breast lines can be deployed.</p>
<p>For a preliminary layout, the guidelines in the British Standards, Part 4, Section 2[5.11], may be used in conjunction with the guidelines below.</p>
<ol>
<li> are provided, the spacing between exterior breasting dolphins shall be between 0.3 and 0.4 LOA of the maximum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT. The spacing between interior breasting dolphins shall be approximately 0.3 to 0.4 LOA of the minimum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT.</li>
<li>If only  are provided, the spacing between the dolphins shall be the smaller (0.3 LOA) of the guidelines specified above.</li>
<li>If bow and stern lines are used for mooring, the spacing between  shall be 1.35 times the LOA of the maximum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT.</li>
<li>The spacing between  shall be 0.8 times the LOA of the maximum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT.</li>
</ol>
<p>The final layout of the mooring and breasting dolphins shall be determined based on the results of the mooring analysis that provides optimal mooring line and breasting forces for the range of vessels to be accommodated. The breasting force under the mooring condition shall not exceed the maximum fender reaction of the fender unit when it is being compressed at the manufacturers rated deflection.</p>

<h3>SECTION 3106F GEOTECHNICAL HAZARDS AND FOUNDATIONS</h3>
<p class="b"><b>3106F.1 General.</b></p>
<p><b>3106F.1.1 Purpose.</b> This section provides minimum standards for analyses and evaluation of geotechnical hazards and foundations.</p>
<p><b>3106F.1.2 Applicability.</b> The requirements provided herein apply to all new and existing MOT<sub>s.</sub></p>
<p><b>3106F.1.3 Seismic loading.</b> The seismic loading for geotechnical hazard assessment and foundation analyses is provided in Section 3103F.4.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3106F.2 Site Characterization.</b></p>
<p><b>3106F.2.1 Site classes.</b> Each MOT shall be assigned at least one site class, based on site-specific geotechnical information. Site Classes S<sub>A</sub>, S<sub>B</sub>, S<sub>C</sub>, S<sub>D</sub>, and S<sub>E</sub> are defined in Table 31F-6-1 and Site Class S<sub>F</sub> is defined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Soils vulnerable to significant potential loss of stiffness, strength, and/or volume under seismic loading, such as liquefiable soils, quick and highly sensitive clays, and collapsible weakly cemented soils.</li>
<li>Peats and/or highly organic clays, where the thickness of peat or highly organic clay exceeds 10 feet.</li>
<li>Very high plasticity clays with a plasticity index (PI) greater than 75, where depth of clay exceeds 25 feet.</li>
<li>Very thick soft/medium stiff clays, where the depth of clay exceeds 120 feet.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>3106F.2.2 Site-Specific information.</b> In general, geotechnical characterization shall be based on site-specific information. This information may be obtained from existing or new sources. However, if existing or nonsite specific information is used, the geotechnical engineer of record shall provide adequate justification for its use.</p>
<p>Site-specific investigations shall include, at a minimum, borings and/or cone penetration tests, soil classifications, configuration, foundation loading and an assessment of seismic hazards. The array (number and depths) of exploratory borings and cone penetration tests (CPT) will depend on the proposed or existing structures and site stratigraphy. The investigation or testing activities shall be completed following the procedures in Section 5 of SCEC [6.3]. CPT data may also be used by first converting to standard penetration test (SPT) data, using an appropriate method, that reflects the effects of soil gradation. If geotechnical data other than SPT and CPT are used, an adequate explanation and rationale shall be provided.</p>
<p>Quantitative soil information is required to a depth of 100 feet below the mudline, for assigning a Site Class (see Table 31F-6-1). When data to a depth of 100 feet is unavailable, other information such as geologic considerations may be used to determine the Site Class.</p>
<p><b>3106F.3 Liquefaction.</b> A liquefaction assessment shall address triggering and the resulting hazards, using residual shear strengths of liquefied soils.</p>
<p><b>3106F.3.1 Triggering assessment.</b> Liquefaction triggering shall be expressed in terms of the factor of safety (SF):</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_548_01.jpg"/></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>CRR = Cyclic Resistance Ratio</p>
<p>CSR = The Cyclic Stress Ratio induced by Design Peak Ground Acceleration (DPGA) or other postulated shaking</p>
<p>The CRR shall be determined from Figure 7.1 in SCEC [6.3]. If available, both the SPT and CPT data can be used.</p>
<p>CSR shall be evaluated using the simplified procedure in Section 3106F.3.1.1 or site-specific response analysis procedures in Section 3106F.3.1.2.</p>
<p>Shaking-induced shear strength reductions in liquefiable materials are determined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>SF&gt;1.4 Reductions of shear strength for the materials for postearthquake conditions may be neglected.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>2. 1.0 &lt; SF &lt; 1.4 A strength value intermediate to the materials's initial strength and residual undrained shear strength should be selected based on the level of residual excess pore water pressure expected to be generated by the ground shaking (e.g., Figure 10 of Seed and Harder, [6.4]).</li>
<li>3. SF &lt; 1.0 Reduction of the material shear strength to a residual undrained shear strength level shall be considered, as described in Section 3106F.3.2.</li></ol>
<p><b>3106F.3.1.1 Simplified procedure.</b> The simplified procedure to evaluate liquefaction triggering shall follow Section 7 of SCEC [6.3]. Cyclic stress ratio (CSR) is used to define seismic loading, in terms of the Design Peak Ground Acceleration (DPGA) and Design Earthquake Magnitude (DEM). DPGA and DEM are addressed in Section 3103F.4.2. CSR is defined as:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="images/gov.ca.bsc.2010.02.2_549_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="b"><b>where:</b></p>
<p>g = gravitational constant</p>
<p>σ<sub>v</sub> = the vertical total stress</p>
<p>σ<sup>1</sup><sub>v</sub> = the vertical effective stress</p>
<p>r<sub>d</sub> = a stress reduction factor</p>
<p>r<sub>MSF</sub> = the magnitude scaling factor</p>
<p>For values of r<sub>MSF</sub> and r<sub>d</sub>, see SCEC [6.3] Figures 7.2 and 7.3, respectively. To evaluate r<sub>MSF</sub>, the DEM value associated with DPGA shall be used.</p>
<p><b>3106F.3.1.2 Site specific response procedure.</b> In lieu of the simplified procedure, either one-dimensional or two-dimensional site response analysis may be performed using the ground motion parameters discussed in Section 3103F.4. The computed cyclic stresses at various points within the pertinent soil layers shall be expressed as values of CSR.</p>
<p><b>3106F.3.2 Residual strength.</b> The residual undrained shear strength may be estimated from Figure 7.7 of SCEC [6.3]. When necessary, a conservative extrapolation of the range should be made. Under no circumstances, shall the residual shear strength be higher than the shear strength based on effective strength parameters.</p>
<p>The best estimate value should correspond to 1/3 from the lower bound of the range for a given value of equivalent clean sand SPT blowcount. When a value other than the “1/3 value” is selected for the residual shear strength, the selection shall be justified. An alternate method is provided in Stark and Mesri [6.5]. The residual strength of liquefied soils may be obtained as a function of effective confining pressures if a justification is provided. The resulting residual shear strength shall be used as the postearthquake shear strength of liquefied soils.</p>
<p><b>3106F.4 Other geotechnical hazards.</b> For a SF less than 1.4, the potential for the following hazards shall be evaluated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flow slides</li>
<li>Slope movements</li>
<li>Lateral spreading</li>
<li>Ground settlement and differential settlement</li>
<li>Other surface manifestations</li>
</ol>
<p>These hazards shall be evaluated, using the residual shear strength described above (Section 3106F.3.2).</p>
<p><b>3106F.4.1 Stability of earth structures.</b> If a slope failure could affect the MOT, a stability analysis of slopes and earth retaining structures shall be performed. The analysis shall use limit equilibrium methods that satisfy all of the force and/or moment equilibrium conditions and determine the slope stability safety factor.</p>
<ol>
<li>Slope stability safety factor ≥1.2 Flow slides can be precluded; however, seismically induced ground movements shall be addressed.</li>
<li>1.0 &lt; Slope stability safety factor &lt;1.2 Seismically induced ground movements should be evaluated using the methods described below.</li>
<li>Slope stability safety factor &lt;1.0</li>
</ol>
<p>Mitigation measures shall be implemented per Section 3106F.6.</p>
<p><b>3106F.4.2 Simplified ground movement analysis.</b> The seismically induced ground settlement may be estimated using Section 7.6 of SCEC [6.3]. Surface manifestation of liquefaction may be evaluated using Section 7.7 of SCEC. Results shall be evaluated to determine if mitigation measures are required.</p>
<p>Seismically induced deformation or displacement of slopes shall be evaluated using the Makdisi-Seed [6.6] simplified method as described below.</p>
<p>The stability analysis shall be used with the residual shear strengths of soils to estimate the yield acceleration coefficient, K<sub>y</sub>, associated with the critical potential movement plane. In general, the DPGA shall be used as K<sub>max</sub>(see [6.6]) and DEM as the earthquake magnitude, M. These parameters shall be used together with the upper bound curves Figures 9-11 of [6.6], to estimate the seismically induced ground movement along the critical plane.</p>
<p>However, the value of K<sub>max</sub> may be different from the DPGA value to include the effects of amplification, incoherence, etc. When such adjustments are made in converting DPGA to K<sub>max</sub>, a justification shall be provided. Linear interpolation using the upper bound curves in Figure 10 (ordinate scale should be divided by 10) in [6.6] or Figure 4-10 in Ferritto et al [6.7] can be used to estimate the seismically induced ground movement for other earthquake magnitudes.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For screening purposes only, lateral spreading shall be evaluated, using the simplified equations in Youd et al. [6.8]. The total seismically induced ground displacement shall include all contributory directions.</p>
<ol>
<li>When the resulting displacement from the screening method is &gt; 0.1 ft., the Makdisi-Seed simplified method or other similar methods shall be used to estimate lateral spreading.</li>
<li>If the computed displacement from the simplified method(s) is ≥ 0.5 ft., the effects can be neglected.</li>
<li>If the computed displacements using simplified methods are &gt; 0.5ft., the use of a detailed ground movement analysis (see Section 3106F.4.3) may be considered.</li>
<li>If the final resulting displacement, regardless of the method used, remains &gt; 0.5 ft., it shall be considered in the structural analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>3106F.4.3 Detailed ground movement analysis.</b> As an alternative to the simplified methods discussed above, a two-dimensional (2-D) equivalent linear or nonlinear dynamic analysis of the MOT and/or slopes and earth retaining systems may be performed.</p>
<p>An equivalent linear analysis is adequate when the stiffness and/or strength of the soils involved are likely to degrade by less than one-third, during seismic excitation of less than 0.5 g's. Appropriate time histories need to be obtained to calculate seismically induced displacement (see Section 3103F.4.2). Such analysis should account for the accumulating effects of displacement if double-integration of acceleration time histories is used. The seismic stresses or stress time histories from equivalent linear analysis may be used to estimate seismically induced deformation.</p>
<p>A nonlinear analysis should be used if the stiffness and/or strength of the soils involved are likely to degrade by more than one-third during seismic motion.</p>
<p>If the structure is included in the analysis, the ground motion directly affects the structural response. Otherwise, the uncoupled, calculated movement of the soil on the structure shall be evaluated.</p>
<p class="b"><b>3106F.5 Soil structure interaction.</b></p>
<p><b>3106F.5.1 Soil parameters.</b> Soil structure interaction (SSI) shall be addressed for the seismic evaluation of MOT structures. SSI may consist of linear or non-linear springs (and possibly dash-pots) for various degrees of freedom, including horizontal, vertical, torsional, and rotational, as required by the structural analysis.</p>
<p>Pile capacity parameters may be evaluated using the procedures in Chapter 4 of <a class="cite" href="sibr/gov.fema.fema356.pdf">FEMA 356</a> [6.9]. The “p-y” curves, “t-z” curves, and tip load—displacement curves for piles (nonlinear springs for horizontal and vertical modes and   group effects. Equivalent springs (and dashpots) representing the degrading properties of soils may be developed.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, alternative procedures can be used to develop these parameters. Rationale for the use of alternative procedures shall be provided. One simplified method is  moment for an isolated pile, subject to a lateral load.</p>
<p><b>3106F.5.2 Shallow foundations.</b> Shallow foundations shall be assumed to move with the ground. Springs and dashpots may be evaluated as per Gazetas [6.12].</p>
<p><b>3106F.5.3 Underground structures.</b> Buried flexible structures or buried portions of flexible structures including piles and pipelines shall be assumed to deform with estimated ground movement at depth.</p>
<p>As the soil settles, it shall be assumed to apply shear forces to buried structures or buried portions of structures including deep foundations.</p>
<p><b>3106F.6 Mitigation measures and alternatives.</b> If the hazards and consequences addressed in Sections 31 06F.3 and 3106F.4 are beyond the specified range, the following options shall be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform a more sophisticated analysis</li>
<li>Modify the structure</li>
<li>Modify the foundation soil</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of possible measures to modify foundation soils are provided in Table 4-1 of [6.7].</p>

<p><b>3107F.2.8.1 Existing ordinary batter piles.</b> Wharves or piers with ordinary (not fused, plugged or having a seismic release mechanism) batter piles typically have a very stiff response when subjected to lateral loads in the direction of the batter. The structures often maintains most of its initial stiffness all the way to failure of the first row of batter piles. Since batter piles most likely will fail under a Level 2 seismic event, the following method may be used to evaluate the post-failure behavior of the wharf or pier:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the failure mechanism of the batter pile-deck connection (refer to Section 3104F.4.7) for typical failure scenarios) and the corresponding lateral displacement.</li>
<li>Release the lateral load between the batter pile and the deck when the lateral failure displacement is reached.</li>
<li>Push on the structure until subsequent failure(s) have been identified.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, following these steps will result in a force-displacement (pushover) curve similar to the one shown in Figure 31F-7-14 for a wharf supported by one row of batter piles.</p>
<p>When the row of batter piles fail in tension or shear, stored energy will be released. The structure will therefore experience a lateral displacement demand following the nonductile pile failures. If the structure can respond to this displacement demand without exceeding other structural limita</p>
<p>tions, it may be assumed that the structure is stable and will start to respond to further shaking with a much longer period and corresponding lower seismic demands. The wharf structure may therefore be able to sustain larger seismic demands following the loss of the batter piles than before the loss of pile capacity, because of a much softer seismic response.</p>
<p>The area under the pushover curve before the batter pile failures is compared to the equivalent area under the post failure pushover curve (refer to Figure 31F-7-14). If no other structural limitations are reached with the new displacement demand, it is assumed that the structure is capable of absorbing the energy. It should be noted that even though the shear failure is nonductile, it is expected that energy will be absorbed and the damping will increase during the damage of the piles. The above method is, therefore, considered conservative.</p>
<p>Following the shear failure of a batter pile row, the period of the structure increases such that equal displacement can be assumed when estimating the post-failure displacement demand. The new period may be estimated from the initial stiffness of the post-failure system as shown in Figure 31F-7-14. A new displacement demand can then be calculated in accordance with Section 3104F.2.</p>

<p class="b"><b>3108F.2 Hazard assessment and risk analysis.</b></p>
<p><b>3108F.2.1 Fire hazard assessment and risk analysis (N/E).</b> A fire hazard assessment and risk analysis shall be performed, considering the loss of commercial power, earthquake and other relevant events.</p>
<p><b>3108F.2.2 Fire plan (N/E).</b> A site-specific fire plan shall be prepared by a registered engineer or a competent fire protection professional. The plan shall consider the hazards and risks identified per Section 3108F.2.1 and shall include, but not be limited to, the elements of prefire planning as discussed in Section 9 of [8.1] and Chapter 3 of [8.2]. The fire plan shall include goals, resources, organization, strategy and tactics, including the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>MOT characteristics (e.g., tanker/manifold, product pipelines, etc.)</li>
<li>Product types and fire scenarios</li>
<li>Possible collateral fire damage to adjacent facilities</li>
<li>Fire-fighting capabilities, including availability of water (flow rates and pressure), foam type and associated shelf life, proportioning equipment, and vehicular access [8.1, 8.3]</li>
<li>The selection of appropriate extinguishing agents [8.1, 8.2]</li>
<li>Calculation of water and foam capacities, as applicable, consistent with area coverage requirements [8.1]</li>
<li>Coordination of emergency efforts</li>
<li>Emergency escape routes [8.2, 8.3]</li>
<li></li>
<li>Life safety</li>
<li>Rescue for terminal and vessel personnel [8.1]</li>
<li>Cooling water for pipelines and valves exposed to the heat</li>
<li>Contingency planning when supplemental fire support is not available. Mutual aid agreements can apply to water and land based support</li>
<li>Consideration of adverse conditions, such as electrical power failure, steam failure, fire pump failure, an earthquake or other damage to the fire water system.</li>

<p><b>3108F.2.3 Cargo liquid and fire hazard classifications(N/E).</b> The cargo liquid hazard classes are defined in Table 31F-8-1, as either High (H<sub>C</sub> or Low (L<sub>C</sub>), depending on the flash point.</p>
<p>Fire hazard classifications (Low, Medium or High) are defined in Table 31F-8-2, and are based on the cargo liquid hazard class and the sum of all stored and flowing volumes, prior to the emergency shut down system (ESD) stopping the flow of oil.</p>
<p>The stored volume is the sum of the H<sub>C</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> liquid hazard class piping volumes (V<sub>SH</sub> and V<sub>SL</sub>), if the piping is not stripped.</p>
<p>During a pipeline leak, a quantity of oil is assumed to spill at the maximum cargo flow rate until the ESD is fully effective. The ESD valve closure is required to be completed in 60 seconds if installed prior to November 1, 1980 or in 30 seconds if installed after that date (2 CCR 2380(h) (3))[8.3]. The flowing volume is the sum of the H<sub>C</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> liquid hazard class volumes (V<sub>FH</sub> and V<sub>FL</sub>), and shall be calculated as follows:</p>
