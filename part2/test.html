<p>Any system or method of construction to be used shall be based on a rational analysis in accordance with well-established principles of mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system that provides a complete load path capable of transferring loads from their point of origin to the load-resisting elements.</p>
<p>The total lateral force shall be distributed to the various vertical elements of the lateral-force-resisting system in proportion to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the horizontal bracing system or diaphragm. Rigid elements assumed not to be a part of the lateral-force-resisting system are permitted to be incorporated into buildings provided their effect on the action of the system is considered and provided for in the design. Except where diaphragms are flexible, or are permitted to be analyzed as flexible, provisions shall be made for the increased forces induced on resisting elements of the structural system resulting from torsion due to eccentricity between the center of application of the lateral forces and the center of rigidity of the lateral-force-resisting system.</p>

<p><b>START OF CONSTRUCTION.</b> The date of issuance for new construction and substantial improvements to existing structures, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, <i>addition,</i> placement or other improvement is within 180 days after the date of issuance. The actual start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, installation of pilings or construction of columns.</p>
<p>Permanent construction does not include land preparation (such as clearing, excavation, grading or filling), the installation of streets or walkways, excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations, the erection of temporary forms or the installation of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as <i>dwelling units</i> or not part of the main building. For a substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first <i>alteration</i> of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that <i>alteration</i> affects the external dimensions of the building.</p>
<p><b>SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.</b> Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.</p>
<p><b>SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.</b> Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, <i>addition</i> or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the <i>building official</i> and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.</li>

<p><b>21.4 Design Acceleration Parameters.</b> Where the site-specific procedure is used to determine the design ground motion in accordance with Section 21.3, the parameter S<sub>DS</sub>shall be taken as the spectral acceleration, S<sub>w</sub> obtained from the site-specific spectra at a period of 0.2 sec, except that it shall not be taken less than 90 percent of the peak spectral acceleration, Sa, at any period larger than 0.2 second. The parameter S<sub>D1</sub>shall be taken as the greater of the spectral acceleration, S<sub>w</sub>, at a period of 1 sec or two times the spectral acceleration, S<sub>w</sub> at a period of 2 sec.</p>
<p>For use with the equivalent lateral force procedure, the site specific spectral acceleration, S<sub>a</sub>at T shall be permitted to replace S<sub>D1</sub>/T in Equation 12.8-3 and S<sub>D1</sub>T<sub>L</sub>/T<sup>2</sup>in Equation 12.8-4. The parameter S<sub>DS</sub>calculated per this section shall be permitted to be used in Equations 12.8-2 and 12.8-5. The mapped value of S<sub>1</sub>shall be used in Equation 12.8-6. The parameters S<sub>MS</sub>and S<sub>M1</sub>shall be taken as 1.5 times S<sub>DS</sub>and S<sub>D1</sub>, respectively. The values so obtained shall not be less than 80 percent of the values determined in accordance with Section 11.4.3 for S<sub>MS</sub>and S<sub>M1</sub>and Section 11.4.4 for S<sub>DS</sub>and S<sub>D1</sub>.</p>

<p><b>1615A.1.37. Earthquake Motion Measuring Instrumentation and Monitoring. [OSHPD 1 &amp; 4]</b> Modify ASCE 7 by the following:</p>
<div>
<p><b>Scope:</b> For buildings with a seismic isolation system, a damping system or a lateral force resisting system (LFRS) not listed in ASCE 7 Table 12.2-1, earthquake motion measuring instrumentation and monitoring shall be required.</p>
<p><b>Instrumentation:</b> There shall be a sufficient number of instruments to characterize the response of the building during an earthquake and shall include at least one tri-axial free field instrument or equivalent. A proposal for instrumentation and equipment specifications shall be forwarded to the enforcement agency for review and approval. The owner of the building shall be responsible for the implementation of the instrumentation program. Maintenance of the instrumentation and removal/processing of the records shall be the responsibility of the enforcement agency.</p>
<p><b>Monitoring:</b> After every significant seismic events, where the ground shaking acceleration at the site exceeds 0.3g, or the acceleration at any monitored building level exceeds 0.8g, as measured by the seismic monitoring system in the building, the owner shall retain a structural engineer to make an inspection of the structural system.The inspection shall include viewing the performance of the building, reviewing the strong motion records, and a visual examination of the isolators, dampers and connections for deterioration, offset or physical damage. A report for each inspection, including conclusions on the continuing adequacy of the structural system, shall be submitted to the enforcement agency.</p>
</div>
<p><b>1615A.1.38 Operational Nonstructural Performance Level Requirements. [OSHPD 1 &amp; 4]</b> New buildings designed and constructed to this code shall be deemed to satisfy operational nonstructural performance level when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The facility has on-site supplies of water and holding tanks for wastewater, sufficient for 72 hours of emergency operations, which are integrated into the building plumbing systems. As an alternative, hook-ups to allow for the use of transportable sources of water and sanitary waste water disposal shall be permitted.</li>
<li>An on-site emergency system as defined within Part 3, Title 24 is incorporated into the building electrical system for critical care areas. Additionally, the system shall provide for radiological service and an onsite fuel supply for 72 hours of acute care operation.</li>
