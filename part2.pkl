All cells shall be solidly filled with grout in reinforced hollow-unit masonry, except as provided in Section 2114A.1. Construction shall be one of the two following methods: The low-lift method where the maximum height of construction laid before grouting is 4 feet (1220 mm), or the high-lift method where the full height of construction between horizontal cold joints is grouted in one operation. General requirements for construction shall be as follows:</p><p><ol>\n<li>All reinforced hollow-unit masonry shall be built to preserve the unobstructed vertical continuity of the cells to be filled. All head joints shall be solidly filled with mortar for a distance in from the face of the wall or unit not less than the thickness of the longitudinal face shells.</li>\n<li>Mortar shall be as specified in Section 2103A.</li>\n<li>Walls and cross webs forming such cells to be filled shall be full bedded in mortar to prevent leakage of grout.</li>\n<li>Bond shall be provided by lapping units in successive vertical courses. Where stack bond is used in reinforced hollow-unit masonry, the open-end type of unit shall be used with vertical reinforcement spaced a maximum of 16 inches (406 mm) on center.</li>\n<li>Vertical cells to be filled shall have vertical alignment sufficient to maintain a clear unobstructed, continuous vertical cell measuring not less than 2 inches by 3 inches (51 mm by 76 mm), except the minimum cell dimension for high-lift grout shall be 3 inches (76 mm).</li>\n<li>At the time of laying, all masonry units shall be free of dust and dirt.</li>\n<li>Grout shall be a workable mix suitable for placing without segregation and shall be thoroughly mixed. Grout shall be placed by pumping or an approved alternate method and shall be placed before initial set or hardening occurs. Grout shall be consolidated by mechanical vibration during placing and reconsolidated after excess moisture has been absorbed, but before workability is lost. The grouting of any section of a wall shall be completed in one day, with no interruptions greater than one hour. </li>\n<li>All reinforcing and wire ties shall be embedded in the grout. The space between masonry unit surfaces and reinforcing shall be a minimum of one bar diameter.</li>\n<li>Horizontal reinforcement shall be placed in bond beam units with a minimum grout cover of 1 inch (25 mm) above steel for each grout pour.

Failure in tension may be dictated by connection strength or by pile pull out.

S'<p><b>3107F.2.8.1 Existing ordinary batter piles.</b> Wharves or piers with ordinary (not fused, plugged or having a seismic release mechanism) batter piles typically have a very stiff response when subjected to lateral loads in the direction of the batter. The structures often maintains most of its initial stiffness all the way to failure of the first row of batter piles. Since batter piles most likely will fail under a Level 2 seismic event, the following method may be used to evaluate the post-failure behavior of the wharf or pier:</p><p><ol>\n<li>Identify the failure mechanism of the batter pile-deck connection (refer to Section 3104F.4.7) for typical failure scenarios) and the corresponding lateral displacement.</li>\n<li>Release the lateral load between the batter pile and the deck when the lateral failure displacement is reached.</li>\n<li>Push on the structure until subsequent failure(s) have been identified.</li>\n</ol></p><p>As an example, following these steps will result in a force-displacement (pushover) curve similar to the one shown in Figure 31F-7-14 for a wharf supported by one row of batter piles.</p><p>When the row of batter piles fail in tension or shear, stored energy will be released. The structure will therefore experience a lateral displacement demand following the nonductile pile failures. If the structure can respond to this displacement demand without exceeding other structural limita</p><p>tions, it may be assumed that the structure is stable and will start to respond to further shaking with a much longer period and corresponding lower seismic demands. The wharf structure may therefore be able to sustain larger seismic demands following the loss of the batter piles than before the loss of pile capacity, because of a much softer seismic response.</p><p>The area under the pushover curve before the batter pile failures is compared to the equivalent area under the post failure pushover curve (refer to Figure 31F-7-14). If no other structural limitations are reached with the new displacement demand, it is assumed that the structure is capable of absorbing the energy. It should be noted that even though the shear failure is nonductile, it is expected that energy will be absorbed and the damping will increase during the damage of the piles. The above method is, therefore, considered conservative.</p><p>Following the shear failure of a batter pile row, the period of the structure increases such that equal displacement can be assumed when estimating the post-failure displacement demand. The new period may be estimated from the initial stiffness of the post-failure system as shown in Figure 31F-7-14. A new displacement demand can then be calculated in accordance with Section 3104F.2.</p>'

S'<p><b>3102F.4.3 Scope.</b> The post-event inspection shall focus on the possible damage caused by the event. General observations of long-term or preexisting deterioration such as significant corrosion-related damage or other deterioration should be made as appropriate, but should not be the focus of the inspection. The inspection shall always include an above-water assessment of structural, mechanical and electrical components.</p><p>The inspection team leader shall determine the need for, and methodology of, an underwater structural assessment, in consultation with the Division. Above water observations, such as shifting or differential settlement, misalignments, significant cracking or spalling, bulging, etc., shall be used to determine whether or not an underwater assessment is required. Similarly, the inspection team leader shall determine, in consultation with the Division, the need for, and methodology of any supplemental inspections (e.g., special inspections (see Section 3102F.3.5.3).</p><p>The following information may be important in determining the need for, and methodology of, the post-event inspection:</p><p><ol>\n<li>Earthquakes or vessel or debris impact typically cause damage both above and below the water line. Following a major earthquake, the inspection should focus on components likely to attract highest lateral loads (batter or shorter piles in the rear of the structure, etc.). In case of vessel or debris impact, the inspection effort should focus on components in the path of the impact mass.</li>\n<li>Major floods or tsunamis may cause undermining of the structure, and/or scouring at the mud line.</li>\n<li>Fire damage varies significantly with the type of the construction materials but all types may be adversely affected. Special inspections (sampling and laboratory testing) shall be conducted, as determined by the inspection team leader, in order to determine the nature and extent of damage.</li>\n<li>High wind or wave events often cause damage both above and below the water line. An underwater inspection may be required if damage is visible above the waterline. Structural damage may be potentially increased if a vessel was at the berth during the event. The effects of high wind may be most prevalent on equipment and connections of such equipment to the structure.</li>\n</ol></p><p>The methodology of conducting an underwater postevent inspection should be established with due consideration of the structure type and type of damage anticipated. Whereas slope failures or scour may be readily apparent in waters of adequate visibility, overstressing cracks on piles covered with marine growth will not be readily apparent. Where such hidden damage is suspected, marine growth removal should be performed on a representative sampling of components in accordance with the Level II effort requirements described in Section 3102F.3.5.2. The cause of the event will determine the appropriate sample size and locations.</p><p> shall be assigned to each berthing system upon completion of the inspection (see Table 31F-2-8). All observations of the above and under water structure, mechanical and electrical components and systems shall be considered in assigning a post-event rating.</p><p>Ratings should consider only damage that was likely caused by the event. Pre-existing deterioration such as corrosion damage should not be considered unless the structural integrity is immediately threatened or safety systems or protection of the environment may be compromised.</p><p>Assignment of ratings should reflect and overall characterization of the berthing system being rated. The rating shall consider both the severity of the deterioration and the extent to which it is widespread throughout the facility. The fact that the facility was designed for loads that are lower than the current standards for design should have no influence upon the ratings.</p>'

The water depth at the berth(s) shall be evaluated, verifying the maximum or loaded draft specified in the MOT\'s Operations Manual (2 CCR 2385 (d)) [2.1].</p><p>The underwater structural inspection shall include the Level I, II and III inspection efforts, as shown in Tables 31F-2-3 and 31F-2-4. The underwater inspection levels of effort are described below, per [2.2]:</p><p>Level I\xe2\x80\x94Includes a close visual examination, or a tactile examination using large sweeping motions of the hands where visibility is limited. Although the Level I effort is often referred to as a "swim-by" inspection, it must be detailed enough to detect obvious major damage or deterioration due to overstress or other severe deterioration. It should confirm the continuity of the full length of all members and confirm the continuity of the full length of all members and detect undermining or exposure of normally buried elements. A Level I effort may also include limited probing of the substructure and adjacent channel bottom.</p><p>Level II\xe2\x80\x94A detailed inspection which requires marine growth removal from a representative sampling of components within the structure. For piles, a 12-inch high band should be cleaned at designated locations, generally near the low waterline, at the mud-line, and midway between the low waterline and the mudline. On a rectangular pile, the marine growth removal should include at least three sides; on an octagon pile, at least six sides; on a round pile, at least three-fourths of the perimeter. On large diameter piles, 3 ft or greater, marine growth removal should be effected on 1 ft by 1 ft areas at four locations approximately equally spaced around the perimeter, at each elevation. On large solid faced elements such as retaining structures, marine growth removal should be effected on 1 ft by 1 ft areas at the three specified elevations. The inspection should also focus on typical areas of weakness, such as attachment points and welds. TheLevel II effort is intended to detect and identify damaged and deteriorated areas that may be hidden by surface biofouling. The thoroughness of marine growth removal should be governed by what is necessary to discern the condition of the underlying structural material. Removal of all biofouling staining is generally not required.</p><p>Level III\xe2\x80\x94A detailed inspection typically involving nondestructive or partially-destructive testing, conducted to detect hidden or interior damage, or to evaluate material homogeneity.</p><p>Typical inspection and testing techniques include the use of ultrasonics, coring or boring, physical material sampling and in-situ hardness testing. Level III testing is generally limited to key structural areas, areas which are suspect, or areas which may be representative of the underwater structure.</p>'

The samples may be limited to particular zones or portions of members if damage is suspected, based on the physical evidence of potential problems. A minimum sample size of three members should be used. A five-percent sample size, up to 30 total members, may be adequate as an upper limit.</p><p>For wrapped timber components, Level III efforts should consist of removal of the wraps from a representative sample of components in order to evaluate the condition of the timber beneath the wrap. The sample may be limited to particular zones or portions of the members if damage is suspected (e.g., at the mudline/bottom of wrap or in the tidal zone). The sample size should be determined based on the physical evidence of potential problems and the aggressiveness of the environment. A minimum sample size of three members should be used.

For near-field events, with sources less than 500 miles away, </p><p>Recent tsunami studies have been completed for both Southern and Northern California. For the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, one of those recent studies focused on near field tsunamis with predicted return periods of 5,000 to 10,000 years [3.22]. These maximum water levels (run-up) would not normally be used for MOT design. However, because the study also provides actual tidal records from recent distant tsunamis, it should be used for design.</p><p>The run-up value for Port Hueneme was obtained from an earlier study by Synolakis et al. [3.23].</p><p>Run up-values: Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach =8ft.</p><p>Port Hueneme = 11 ft.</p><p>For the San Francisco Bay, a recent study provides the maximum credible tsunami water levels and current speeds. These results are deterministic and are based on the most severe seismic sources that could reasonably impact MOT<sub>s</sub> in the San Francisco Bay [3.24]. Table 31F-3-8 provides values for the marine oil terminal locations within San Francisco Bay. Water levels could be positive or negative and current velocities may vary in direction. In order to determine the maximum run-up at a MOT, the largest values should be added to the mean high tide.

Any building or structure or portion thereof that meets any of the conditions described below shall be deemed dangerous:</p><p><ol>\n<li>The building or structure has collapsed, partially collapsed, moved off its foundation or lacks the support of ground necessary to support it.</li>\n<li>There exists a significant risk of collapse, detachment or dislodgment of any portion, member, appurtenance or ornamentation of the building or structure under service loads.</li>\n</ol></p><p><b>EXISTING STRUCTURE.</b> A structure erected prior to the date of adoption of the appropriate code, or one for which a legal building permit has been issued.</p><p><b>PRIMARY FUNCTION.</b> A primary function is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, the customer service lobby of a bank, the dining area of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and other work areas in which the activities of the public accommodation or other private entity using the facility are carried out. Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, corridors and restrooms are not areas containing a primary function.</p><p><b>SUBSTANTIAL STRUCTURAL DAMAGE.</b> A condition where:</p><p><ol>\n<li>In any story, the vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system have suffered damage such that the lateral load-carrying capacity of the structure in any horizontal direction has been reduced by more than 20 percent from its pre-damage condition; or</li>\n<li>The capacity of any vertical gravity load-carrying component, or any group of such components, that supports more than 30 percent of the total area of the structure's floor(s) and roof(s) has been reduced more than 20 percent from its predamage condition and the remaining capacity of such affected elements, with respect to all dead and live loads, is less than 75 percent of that required by this code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose and location.</li>\n</ol></p><p><b>TECHNICALLY INFEASIBLE</b>. An alteration of a building or a facility that has little likelihood of being accomplished because the existing structural conditions require the removal or alteration of a load-bearing member that is an essential part of the structural frame, or because other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces or features which are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements for new construction and which are necessary to provide accessibility.</p>"
