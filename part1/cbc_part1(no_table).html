<p><b>AEROSOL CONTAINER.</b> A metal can or a glass or plastic bottle designed to dispense an aerosol. Metal cans shall be limited to a maximum size of 33.8 fluid ounces (1000 ml). Glass or plastic bottles shall be limited to a maximum size of 4 fluid ounces (118 ml).</p>
<p><b>BALED COTTON.</b> A natural seed fiber wrapped in and secured with industry accepted materials, usually consisting of burlap, woven polypropylene, polyethylene or cotton or sheet polyethylene, and secured with steel, synthetic or wire bands or wire; also includes linters (lint removed from the cottonseed) and motes (residual materials from the ginning process).</p>
<p><b>BALED COTTON, DENSELY PACKED.</b> Cotton made into banded bales with a packing density of at least 22 pounds per cubic foot (360 kg/m<sup>3</sup>), and dimensions complying with the following: a length of 55 inches (1397 ± 20 mm), a width of 21 inches (533.4 ± 20 mm) and a height of 27.6 to 35.4 inches (701 to 899 mm).</p>
<p><b>BARRICADE.</b> A structure that consists of a combination of walls, floor and roof, which is designed to withstand the rapid release of energy in an explosion and which is fully confined, partially vented or fully vented; or other effective method of shielding from explosive materials by a natural or artificial barrier.</p>
<p><b>Artificial barricade.</b> An artificial mound or revetment a minimum thickness of 3 feet (914 mm).</p>
<p><b>Natural barricade.</b> Natural features of the ground, such as hills, or timber of sufficient density that the surrounding exposures that require protection cannot be seen from the magazine or building containing explosives when the trees are bare of leaves.</p>
<p><b>BOILING POINT.</b> The temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the atmospheric pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) (101 kPa) gage or 760 mm of mercury. Where an accurate boiling point is unavailable for the material in question, or for mixtures which do not have a constant boiling point, for the purposes of this classification, the 20-percent evaporated point of a distillation performed in accordance with ASTM D 86 shall be used as the boiling point of the liquid.</p>
<p><b>CLOSED SYSTEM.</b> The use of a solid or liquid hazardous material involving a closed vessel or system that remains closed during normal operations where vapors emitted by the product is not liberated outside of the vessel or system and the product is not exposed to the atmosphere during normal operations; and all uses of compressed gases. Examples of closed systems for solids and liquids include product conveyed through a piping system into a closed vessel, system or piece of equipment.</p>
<p><b>COMBUSTIBLE DUST.</b> Finely divided solid material that is 420 microns or less in diameter and which, when dispersed in air in the proper proportions, could be ignited by a flame, spark </p>
<p>or other source of ignition. Combustible dust will pass through a U.S. No. 40 standard sieve.</p>
<p><b>COMBUSTIBLE FIBERS.</b> Readily ignitable and free-burning materials in a fibrous or shredded form, such as cocoa fiber, cloth, cotton, excelsior, hay, hemp, henequen, istle, jute, kapok, oakum, rags, sisal, Spanish moss, straw, tow, wastepaper, certain synthetic fibers or other like materials.

<p><b>Class IIIB.</b> Liquids having a closed cup flash point at or above 200°F (93°C).</p>
<p>The category of combustible liquids does not include compressed gases or cryogenic fluids.</p>
<p><b>COMPRESSED GAS.</b> A material, or mixture of materials, that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is a gas at 68°F (20°C) or less at 14.7 pounds per square inch atmosphere (psia) (101 kPa) of pressure; and</li>
<li>Has a boiling point of 68°F (20°C) or less at 14.7 psia (101 kPa) which is either liquefied, nonliquefied or in solution, except those gases which have no other health no physical-hazard properties are not considered to be compressed until the pressure in the packaging exceeds 41 psia (282 kPa) at 68°F (20°C).</li>

<p><b>DEFLAGRATION.</b> An exothermic reaction, such as the extremely rapid oxidation of a flammable dust or vapor in air, in which the reaction progresses through the unburned material at a rate less than the velocity of sound. A deflagration can have an explosive effect.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>DETONATION.</b> An exothermic reaction characterized by the presence of a shock wave in the material which establishes and maintains the reaction. The reaction zone progresses through the material at a rate greater than the velocity of sound. The principal heating mechanism is one of shock compression. Detonations have an explosive effect.</p>
<p><b>DISPENSING.</b> The pouring or transferring of any material from a container, tank or similar vessel, whereby vapors, dusts, fumes, mists or gases are liberated to the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>EXPLOSION.</b> An effect produced by the sudden violent expansion of gases, which may be accompanied by a shock wave or disruption, or both, of enclosing materials or structures. An explosion could result from any of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chemical changes such as rapid oxidation, deflagration or detonation, decomposition of molecules and runaway polymerization (usually detonations).</li>
<li>Physical changes such as pressure tank ruptures.</li>
<li>Atomic changes (nuclear fission or fusion).</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>High explosive.</b> Explosive material, such as dynamite, which can be caused to detonate by means of a No. 8 test blasting cap when unconfined.</p>
<p><b>Low explosive.</b> Explosive material that will burn or deflagrate when ignited. It is characterized by a rate of reaction that is less than the speed of sound. Examples of low explosives include, but are not limited to, black powder; safety fuse; igniters; igniter cord; fuse lighters; fireworks, 1.3G (Class B, Special) and propellants, 1.3C.</p>
<p><b>Mass-detonating explosives.</b> Division 1.1, 1.2 and 1.5 explosives alone or in combination, or loaded into various types of ammunition or containers, most of which can be</p>
<p>expected to explode virtually instantaneously when a small portion is subjected to fire, severe concussion, impact, the impulse of an initiating agent or the effect of a considerable discharge of energy from without. Materials that react in this manner represent a mass explosion hazard. Such an explosive will normally cause severe structural damage to adjacent objects. Explosive propagation could occur immediately to other items of ammunition and explosives stored sufficiently close to and not adequately protected from the initially exploding pile with a time interval short enough so that two or more quantities must be considered as one for quantity-distance purposes.</p>
<p><b>UN⁄DOTn Class 1 explosives.</b> The former classification system used by DOTn included the terms “high” and “low” explosives as defined herein. The following terms further define explosives under the current system applied by DOTn for all explosive materials defined as hazard Class 1 materials. Compatibility group letters are used in concert with the division to specify further limitations on each division noted (i.e., the letter G identifies the material as a pyrotechnic substance or article containing a pyrotechnic substance and similar materials).</p>
<p><b>Division 1.1.</b> Explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the entire load instantaneously.</p>

The explosive effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package.</p>
<p><b>Division 1.5.</b> Very insensitive explosives. This division is comprised of substances that have a mass explosion hazard, but that are so insensitive there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal conditions of transport.</p>
<p><b>Division 1.6.</b> Extremely insensitive articles which do no have a mass explosion hazard. This division is comprised of articles that contain only extremely insensitive detonating substances and which demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation.</p>

<a name="s1004"></a><h2>SECTION 1004 OCCUPANT LOAD</h2>
<p><b>1004.1 Design occupant load.</b> In determining means of egress requirements, the number of occupants for whom means of egress facilities shall be provided shall be determined in accordance with this section. Where occupants from accessory areas egress through a primary space, the calculated occupant load for the primary space shall include the total occupant load of the primary space plus the number of occupants egressing through it from the accessory area.</p>
<p><b>1004.1.1 Areas without fixed seating.</b> The number of occupants shall be computed at the rate of one occupant per unit of area as prescribed in Table 1004.1.1. For areas without fixed seating, the occupant load shall not be less than that number determined by dividing the floor area under consideration by the occupant per unit of area factor assigned to the occupancy as set forth in Table 1004.1.1. Where an intended use is not listed in Table 1004.1.1, the building official shall establish a use based on a listed use that most nearly resembles the intended use.</p>
<p><b>Exception:</b> Where approved by the building official, the actual number of occupants for whom each occupied space, floor or building is designed, although less than those determined by calculation, shall be permitted to be used in the determination of the design occupant load.</p>
<p><b>1004.2 Increased occupant load.</b> The occupant load permitted in any building, or portion thereof, is permitted to be increased from that number established for the occupancies in Table 1004.1.1, provided that all other requirements of the code are also met based on such modified number and the occupant load does not exceed one occupant per 7 square feet (0.65 m<sup>2</sup>) of occupiable floor space. Where required by the building official, an approved aisle, seating or fixed equipment diagram substantiating any increase in occupant load shall be submitted. Where required by the building official, such diagram shall be posted.</p>
<p><b>1004.3 Posting of occupant load.</b> Every room or space that is an assembly occupancy shall have the occupant load of the room or space posted in a conspicuous place, near the main exit or exit access doorway from the room or space. Posted signs shall be of an approved legible permanent design and shall be maintained by the owner or authorized agent.</p>
<p><b>1004.4 Exiting from multiple levels.</b> Where exits serve more than one floor, only the occupant load of each floor considered individually shall be used in computing the required capacity of the exits at that floor, provided that the exit capacity shall not decrease in the direction of egress travel.</p>

<p><b>1004.5 Egress convergence.</b> Where means of egress from floors above and below converge at an intermediate level, the capacity of the means of egress from the point of convergence shall not be less than the sum of the two floors.</p>
<p><b>1004.6 Mezzanine levels.</b> The occupant load of a mezzanine level with egress onto a room or area below shall be added to that room or area’s occupant load, and the capacity of the exits shall be designed for the total occupant load thus established.</p>
<p><b>1004.7 Fixed seating.</b> For areas having fixed seats and aisles, the occupant load shall be determined by the number of fixed seats installed therein. The occupant load for areas in which fixed seating is not installed, such as waiting spaces and wheelchair spaces, shall be determined in accordance with Section 1004.1.1 and added to the number of fixed seats.</p>
<p>For areas having fixed seating without dividing arms, the occupant load shall not be less than the number of seats based on one person for each 18 inches (457 mm) of seating length.</p>
<p>The occupant load of seating booths shall be based on one person for each 24 inches (610 mm) of booth seat length measured at the backrest of the seating booth.</p>

<p><b>1105A.1 General.</b> Garages, carports and other parking facilities, which are accessory to covered multifamily dwelling units, shall be accessible as required in Section 1109A.</p>
<a name="s1106A"></a><h2>SECTION 1106A SITE AND BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p><b>1106A.1 General.</b> Covered multifamily dwelling with elevators shall be designed and constructed to provide at least one accessible entrance on an accessible route, regardless of terrain or unusual characteristics of the site. Covered multifamily dwellings without elevators shall be designed and constructed to provide at least one accessible entrance on an accessible route unless terrain or unusual characteristics of the site prevent an accessible route based on the conditions listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li><b> Accessible entrance.</b> Regardless of site considerations described in Section 1150A, an accessible entrance on an accessible route is required when there is an elevator connecting the parking area with the dwelling units on a ground floor. (In this case, those dwelling units on the ground floor served by an elevator, and at least one of each type of public- and common-use areas, would be subject to these requirements.)</li>
<li><b>Elevator building.</b> When a building elevator or elevators are provided as a means of access to dwelling units other than dwelling units on a ground floor (see Section 1104A.2), the building is an elevator building. all dwelling units become covered multifamily dwellings in that building. the elevator in that building must provide accessibility to all dwelling units in the building, regardless of the slope of the natural terrain. For multistory dwelling  1102A.3.2. 
<p><b>Note:</b> Where a building elevator is provided only as means of creating an accessible route to covered multifamily dwelling units on a ground floor, the building is not considered to be an elevator building, only dwelling units located on the ground floor shall be required to comply with this chapter.</p></li>
<li><b> Elevated walkway.</b> When an elevated walkway is planned between a building entrance and a vehicular or pedestrian arrival point, and the planned walkway has a slope no greater than 10 percent (1 unit vertical in 10 units horizontal), the floor being served by the elevated walkway becomes a ground floor and accessibility to all dwellings on that ground floor is required. 
<p><b>Note:</b> Since the planned walkway meets the 10 percent slope criterion, it is required to provided an accessible route to the entrance, and the slope of the walkway must be reduced to 1 unit vertical in 12 units horizontal (8.33 percent slope) maximum.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>1106A.2 Site impracticality.</b> for tests to determine site impracticality due to terrain considerations in nonelevator buildings, see Section 1150A.</p>

<p><b>1150A.1 General.</b> Covered multifamily dwellings in buildings without an elevator, located on sites with difficult terrain conditions or unusual characteristics, may employ the site impracticality tests in this division for determining the accessibility and adaptability provisions required by this chapter.</p>
<p>Except as provided for in Section 1102A.3.1, the provisions of this section do not apply to multistory dwelling units in nonelevator buildings.</p>
<table border="1" class="i">
<tbody>
<tr><td><b></b> The following may only be used for determining required access to covered multifamily dwelling units, in a single building with one common (lobby) entrance, located on a site with difficult terrain conditions or unusual characteristics: All ground floor units in nonelevator buildings shall be adaptable and on an accessible route unless an accessible route to the common (lobby) entrance is not required as determined by Test No. 1, Individual Building Test, or Test No. 3, Unusual Characteristics Test, as described in this section. Sites where either Test No. 1 or Test No. 3 is used and it is determined that an accessible route to the common (lobby) entrance is not required, at least 20 percent of the ground floor dwelling units shall comply with Division IV, and all remaining ground floor dwelling units shall comply with the features listed in Section 1150A.2 unless exempted by Test No. 3, Unusual Characteristics Test. Test No. 1-Individual Building Test may only be used if the site has terrain over 15 percent slope. Test No. 3-Unusual Characteristics Test may be used if applicable.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><b>Provisions to Test Nos. 1 and 2.</b> Where a building elevator is provided only as means of creating an accessible route to covered multifamily dwelling units on a ground floor, the building is not considered to be an elevator building for purposes of this code; hence, only the ground floor dwelling units would be covered.</p>
<p class="b"><b>TEST NO. 1-INDIVIDUAL BUILDING TEST</b></p>
<p>It is not required by this code to provide an accessible route when the terrain of the site is such that both of the following apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>The slopes of the undisturbed site measured between the planned entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance exceed 15 percent; and</li>
<li>The slopes of the planned finished grade measured between the entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance also exceed 15 percent.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, the slope for the purposes of Test No. 1 will be measured to the closest vehicular or pedestrian arrival point.</p>
<p>For purposes of these requirements, vehicular or pedestrian arrival points include public or resident parking areas, public transportation stops, passenger loading zones and public streets or sidewalks. To determine site impracticality, the slope would be measured at ground level from the point of the planned entrance on a straight line to (1) each vehicular or pedestrian arrival point that is within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, or (2) if there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within the specified area, the vehicular or pedestrian arrival point closest to the planned entrance. In the case of sidewalks, the closest point to the planned entrance will be where a public sidewalk entering the site interests with the walk to the entrance. In the case of resident parking areas, the closest point to the planned entrance will be measured from the entry point to the parking area that is located closest to the planned entrance.</p>
<p class="b"><b>TEST NO. 2-SITE ANALYSIS TEST</b></p>
<p>For a site having multiple buildings, or a site with a single building with multiple entrances, it is not required to provide an accessible route to all ground floor units under the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the percentage of the total buildable area of the undisturbed site with a natural grade less than 10-percent slope. The analysis of the existing slope (before grading) shall be done on a topographic survey with 2-foot (610 mm) contour intervals with slope determination made between each successive interval. The accuracy of the slope analysis shall be certified by a licensed engineer, landscape architect, architect or surveyor.</li>
<li>Determine the requirement of providing an accessible route to planned multifamily dwellings based on the topography of the existing natural terrain. The minimum percentage of ground floor units required on an accessible route shall equal the percentage of the total buildable area (not restricted-use areas) of the undisturbed site with an existing natural grade of less than 10-percent slope. In no case shall less than 20 percent of the ground floor dwelling units be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Division IV.</li>
<li>In addition to the percentage established in paragraph (2), all additional ground floor units in a building, or ground floor units served by a particular entrance, that fall within an 8.33-percent slope between their planned entrances and an arrival point 
 shall be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Division IV.</li>
<li>All additional ground floor units in a building, or ground floor units served by a particular entrance, not on an accessible route shall comply with the features listed in Section 1150A.2.</li>
</ol>
<p class="b"><b>TEST NO. 3-UNUSUAL CHARACTERISTICS TEST</b></p>
<p> federally designated floodplain or coastal high-hazard areas and sites subject to other similar requirements of law or code that require the lowest floor or the lowest structural member of the lowest floor to be designed to a specified level at or above the base flood elevation. An accessible route to a building entrance is impractical due to unusual characteristics of the site when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The original site characteristics result in a difference in finished grade elevation exceeding 30 inches (762 mm) and 10 percent measured between an entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance; or</li>
<li>If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, the unusual characteristics result in a difference in finished grade elevation exceeding 30 inches (762 mm) and 10 percent measured between an entrance and the closest vehicular or pedestrian arrival point.</li>
</ol>
<p class="b"><b>1150A.2 Additional requirements for Section 1150A.</b></p>
<p>All other ground floor dwelling units in nonelevator buildings shall be made to comply with the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab bar reinforcement: see Section 1134A.</li>
<li>Thirty-two inch (813 mm) clear door interior opening width: see Section 1132A.3.</li>
<li>Lever hardware: see Section 1132A.8.</li>
<li>Door signal devices: see Section 1132A.10.</li>
<li>Clear space by doors: see Chapters 10 and 11A.</li>
<li>Minimum 15-inch (381 mm) water closet seat height: see Section 1134A.7, Item 3.</li>
<li>Electrical receptacle outlet height: see Section 1136A.</li>
<li>Lighting and environmental control height: see Section 1136A.</li>
<li>Faucet controls: see Section 1134A.8, Item 7.</li>
<li>Water closet, bathtub and lavatory minimum space requirements: see Section 1134A.</li>
<li>Removable cabinets under the kitchen sink counter area: see Section 1133A.3.</li>

<p><b>1103B.1 Scope.</b> Accessibility to buildings or portions of buildings shall be provided for all occupancy classifications except as modified or enhanced by this chapter. Occupancy requirements in this chapter may modify general requirements, but never to the exclusion of them. When a building or facility contains more than one use, the occupancy specific accessibility provisions for each portion of the building or facility shall apply.</p>
<p>An accessible route of travel complying with Section 1114B.1.2 shall connect all elements and spaces within a building or facility. Multistory buildings and facilities must provide access to each level, including mezzanines, by ramp or passenger elevator complying with Section 1116B. If more than one elevator is provided, each passenger elevator shall comply with Section 1116B.</p>
<p class="b"><b>Exceptions:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Floors or portions of floors not customarily occupied, including, but not limited to, nonoccupiable or employee spaces accessed only by ladders, catwalks, crawl spaces, very narrow passageways or freight (nonpassenger) elevators, and frequented only by  elevator penthouses, piping and equipment catwalks, and machinery rooms.</li>
<li>The following types of privately funded multistory buildings do not require a ramp or elevator above and below the first floor:
<ol>
<li>Multistoried office buildings (other than the professional office of a health care provider) and passenger vehicle service stations less than three stories high or less than 3,000 square feet (279 m<sup>2</sup>) per story.</li>
<li>Any other privately funded multistoried building that is not a shopping center, shopping mall or the professional office of a health care provider, or a terminal, depot or other station used for specified public transportation, or an  than three stories high or less than 3,000 square feet (279 m<sup>2</sup>) per story if a reasonable portion of all facilities and accommodations

normally sought and used by the public in such a building are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.</li></ol></li></ol>
<p>The elevator exception set forth in this section does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements in this code. For example, floors above or below the accessible ground floor must meet the requirements of this section except for elevator service. If toilet or bathing facilities are provided on a level not served by an elevator, then toilet or bathing facilities must be provided on the accessible ground floor.</p>
<p>If a building or facility is eligible for this exception but a passenger elevator is nonetheless planned, that elevator shall meet the requirements of Section 1116B and shall serve each level in the building. A passenger elevator that provides service from a garage to only one level of a building or facility is not required to serve other levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1103B.2 Distance to elevators.</b> In new construction of  which exceed 10,000 square feet (929 m<sup>2</sup>) on any floor, an accessible means of vertical access via ramp, elevator or lift shall be provided within 200 feet (60 960 mm) of travel of each stair and each escalator. In existing buildings that exceed 10,000 square feet (929 m<sup>2</sup>) on any floor and in which elevators  newly constructed means of vertical access is provided via stairs or an escalator, an accessible means of vertical access via ramp, elevator or lift shall be provided within 200 feet (60 960 mm) of travel of each new stair or escalator.</p>

<p class="b"><b>Division IV-ACCESSIBILITY FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS</b></p>
<a name="s1134B"></a><h2>SECTION 1134B ACCESSIBILITY FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS</h2>
<p><b>1134B.1 Scope.</b> The provisions of this division apply to renovation, structural repair, alteration and additions to existing buildings, including those identified as historic buildings. This division identifies minimum standards for removing architectural barriers, and providing and maintaining accessibility to existing buildings and their related facilities.</p>
<p>No renovation, structural repair, alteration or addition shall be undertaken which decreases or has the effect of decreasing accessibility or usability of a building or facility below the requirements for new construction at the time of renovation, structural repair, alteration or addition.</p>
<p> comply with all provisions of Division I-New Buildings, except as modified by this division. These requirements shall apply only to the area of specific alteration, structural repair or addition and shall include those areas listed below:</p>
<p><b>1134B.2.1</b> A primary entrance to the building or facility and the primary path of travel to the specific area of alteration, structural repair or addition, and sanitary facilities, drinking fountains, signs and public telephones serving the area.</p>
<p class="b"><b>Exceptions:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>When the total construction cost of alterations, structural repairs or additions does not exceed a valuation threshold of $50,000, based on January 1981, “ENR US20 Cities” Average Construction Cost Index of 3372.02 (Engineering News Record, McGraw Hill Publishing Company), and the enforcing agency finds that compliance with this code creates an unreasonable hardship, compliance shall be limited to the actual work of the project. The enforcing agency shall annually update the valuation threshold to a current amount based on the increase in the index since the last figure used. (For example, the January 2010 amount is $128,410.86.) For purposes of this exception, an unreasonable hardship exists where the cost of providing an accessible entrance, path of travel, sanitary facilities, public phones and drinking fountains is disproportionate to the cost of the project; that is, where it exceeds 20 percent of the cost of the project without these features. Where the cost of alterations necessary to make these features fully accessible is disproportionate, access shall be provided to the extent that it can be without incurring disproportionate cost. In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access in the following order:
<ol>
<li>An accessible entrance;</li>
<li>An accessible route to the altered area;</li>
<li>At least one accessible restroom for each sex;</li>
<li>Accessible telephones;</li>
<li>Accessible drinking fountains; and</li>
<li>When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage and alarms. The obligation to provide access may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking. If an area has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area or a different area on the same path of travel are undertaken within three years of the original alterations to the areas on that path of travel during the preceding three-year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate. Only alterations undertaken after January 26, 1992, shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Certain types of privately funded, multistory buildings and facilities were formerly exempt from accessibility requirements above and below the first floor under this code, but as of the effective date of this regulation are no longer exempt due to more restrictive provisions in the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. In alteration projects involving buildings and facilities previously approved and built without elevators, areas above and below the ground floor are subject to the 20-percent disproportionality provisions described in Exception 1, above, even if the value of the project exceeds the valuation threshold in Exception 1. The types of buildings and facilities are:
<ol>
<li>Office buildings and passenger vehicle service stations of three stories or more and 3,000 or more square feet (279 m<sup>2</sup>) per floor.</li>
<li>Offices of physicians and surgeons.</li>
<li>Shopping centers.</li>
<li>Other buildings and facilities three stories or more and 3,000 or more square feet (279 m<sup>2</sup>) per floor if a reasonable portion of services sought and used by the public is available on the accessible level. For the general privately funded multistory building exception applicable to new construction and alterations, see Section 1103B.1, Exception 2. The elevator exception set forth in this section does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements in this code. For example, floors above or below
the accessible ground floor must meet the requirements of this section except for elevator service. If toilet or bathing facilities are provided on a level not served by an elevator, then toilet or bathing facilities must be provided on the accessible ground floor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Alterations, structural repairs or additions consisting of one or more of the following shall be limited to the actual work of the project:
<ol>
<li>Altering one building entrance to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li>Altering one existing toilet facility to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li>Altering existing elevators to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li>Altering existing steps to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li>Altering existing handrails to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li> requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-336, 28  requirements of this code as those requirements or regulations now exist or are hereafter amended, including the following:
<ol>
<li>Installing ramps.</li>
<li>Making curb cuts in sidewalks and entrance.</li>
<li>Repositioning shelves.</li>
<li>Rearranging tables, chairs, vending machines, display racks, and other furniture.</li>
<li>Repositioning telephones.</li>
<li>Adding raised markings on elevator control buttons.</li>
<li>Installing flashing alarm lights.</li>
<li>Widening doors.</li>
<li>Installing offset hinges to widen doorways.</li>
<li>Eliminating a turnstile or providing an alternative accessible path.</li>
<li>Installing accessible door hardware.</li>
<li>Installing grab bars in toilet stalls.</li>
<li>Rearranging toilet partitions to increase maneuvering space.</li>
<li>Insulating lavatory pipes under sinks to prevent burns.</li>
<li>Installing a raised toilet seat.</li>
<li>Installing a full-length bathroom mirror.</li>
<li>Repositioning the paper towel dispenser in a bathroom.</li>
<li>Creating designated accessible parking spaces.</li>
<li>Installing an accessible paper cup dispenser at an existing in-accessible water fountain.</li>
<li>Removing high-pile, low-density carpeting.</li>
<li>Installing vehicle hand controls.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Altering existing parking lots by resurfacing and/or restriping.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Projects which consist only of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, reroofing, electrical work not involving placement of switches and receptacles, cosmetic work that does not affect items regulated by this code, such as painting, equipment not considered to be a part of the architecture of the building or area, such as computer terminals, office equipment, etc., are not considered alteration projects for the purposes of accessibility for persons with disabilities and shall not be subject to this code unless they affect the usability of the building or facility. For the purposes of this section, the term “construction cost” does not include building permit fees or discretionary permit fees. The only purpose of this exception is to exclude projects from activating the provisions of this section. The exceptions are not intended to relieve projects from complying with other applicable provisions of this code (e.g., replacement of carpet does not activate the provisions of this section; however, it still must comply with Section 1124B.3).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>1134B.2.2</b> Where it is technically infeasible in the area of an alteration to make existing toilet facilities code compliant and to install separate toilet facilities for each sex, then the installation of at least one unisex toilet/facility per floor being altered, located in the same area as existing toilet facilities, will be permitted. Such a facility shall meet the requirements of Section 1115B.3.2.</p>

<p><b>1207.1 Purpose and scope.</b> The purpose of this section is to establish uniform minimum noise insulation performance standards to protect persons within hotels, motels, dormitories, apartment houses and dwellings other than detached single-family dwellings from the effects of excessive noise, including, but not limited to, hearing loss or impairment and interference with speech and sleep. This section shall apply to all buildings for which applications for building permits were made subsequent to August 22, 1974.</p>
<p><b>1207.2 Definitions.</b> The following special definitions shall apply to this section:</p>
<p><b>SOUND TRANSMISSION CLASS (STC)</b> is a single-number rating used to compare walls, floor-ceiling assemblies and doors for their sound-insulating properties with respect to speech and small household appliance noise. The STC is derived from laboratory measurements of sound transmission loss across a series of 16 test bands.</p>
<p>Laboratory STC ratings should be used to the greatest extent possible in determining that the design complies with this section.</p>
<p><b>FIELD SOUND TRANSMISSION CLASS (FSTC)</b> is a single-number rating similar to STC, except that the transmission loss values used to derive the FSTC are measured in the field. All sound transmitted from the source room to the receiving room is assumed to be through the separating wall or floor-ceiling assembly.</p>
<p>This section does not require determination of the FSTC, and field-measured values of noise reduction should not be reported as transmission loss.</p>
<p><b>IMPACT INSULATION CLASS (IIC)</b> is a single-number rating used to compare the effectiveness of floor-ceiling assemblies in providing reduction of impact-generated sounds such as footsteps. The IIC is derived from laboratory measurements of impact sound pressure level across a series of 16 test bands using a standardized tapping machine. Laboratory IIC ratings should be used to the greatest extent possible in determining that the design complies with this section.</p>
<p><b>FIELD IMPACT INSULATION CLASS (FIIC)</b> is a single-number rating similar to the IIC, except that the impact sound pressure levels are measured in the field</p>
<p><b>NOISE ISOLATION CLASS (NIC)</b> is a single-number rating derived from measured values of noise reduction between two enclosed spaces that are connected by one or more paths. The NIC is not adjusted or normalized to a standard reverberation time.</p>
<p><b>NORMALIZED NOISE ISOLATION CLASS (NNIC)</b> is a single-number rating similar to the NIC, except that the measured noise reduction values are normalized to a reverberation time of one-half second.</p>
<p><b>NORMALIZED A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL DIFFERENCE (Dn)</b> means for a specified source room sound spectrum, Dn is the difference, in decibels, between the average sound levels produced in two rooms after adjustment to the expected acoustical conditions when the receiving room under test is normally furnished.</p>
<p><b>DAY-NIGHT AVERAGE SOUND LEVEL (Ldn)</b> is the A-weighted equivalent continuous sound exposure level for a 24-hour period with a 10 db adjustment added to sound levels occurring during nighttime hours (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.).</p>
<p><b>COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL (CNEL)</b> is a metric similar to the Ldn, except that a 5 db adjustment is added to the equivalent continuous sound exposure level for evening hours (7 p.m. to 10 p.m.) in addition to the 10 db nighttime adjustment used in the Ldn.</p>
<p><b>1207.3 Relevant standards.</b> The current edition of the following standards is generally applicable for determining compliance with this section. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) at 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohoken, PA, 19428-2959.</p>

<p><b>1207.4 Complaints.</b> Where a complaint as to noncompliance with this chapter requires a field test, the complainant shall post a bond or adequate funds in escrow for the cost of said testing. Such costs shall be chargeable to the complainant if the field tests show compliance with this chapter. If the tests show noncompliance, testing costs shall be borne to the owner or builder.</p>
<p><b>1207.5 Local modification.</b> The governing body of any city or county or city and county may, by ordinance, adopt changes or modifications to the requirements of this section as set forth in Section 17922.7 of the Health and Safety Code.</p>
<p class="b"><b>1207.6 Interdwelling sound transmission control.</b></p>
<p><b>1207.6.1 Wall and floor-ceiling assemblies.</b> Wall and floor-ceiling assemblies separating dwelling units or guest rooms from each other and from public or service areas such as interior corridors, garages and mechanical spaces shall provide airborne sound insulation for walls, and both airborne and impact sound insulation for floor-ceiling assemblies.</p>
<p><b>Exception:</b> Impact sound insulation is not required for floor-ceiling assemblies over nonhabitable rooms or spaces not designed to be occupied, such as garages, mechanical rooms or storage areas.</p>
<p><b>1207.7 Airborne sound insulation.</b> All such acoustically rated separating wall and floor-ceiling assemblies shall provide airborne sound insulation equal to that required to meet a sound transmission class (STC) rating of 50 based on laboratory tests as defined in ASTM E 90 and E 413. Field-tested assemblies shall meet a noise isolation class (NIC) rating of 45 for occupied units and a normalized noise isolation class (NINIC) rating of 45 for unoccupied units as defined in ASTM E 336 and E 413.</p>
<p>ASTM E 597 may be used as simplified procedure for field tests of the airborne sound isolation between rooms in unoccupied buildings. In such tests, the minimum value of Dn is 45 db for compliance.</p>
<p>Entrance doors from interior corridors together with their perimeter seals shall have STC ratings not less than 26. Such tested doors shall operate normally with commercially available seals.</p>
<p>Solid-core wood-slab doors 1 3/8 inches (35 mm) thick minimum or 18 gauge insulated steel-slab doors with compression seals all around, including the threshold, may be considered adequate without other substantiating information.</p>
<p>Field tests of corridor walls should not include segments with doors. If such tests are impractical, however, the NIC or NNIC rating for the composite wall-door assembly shall not be less than 30.</p>
<p>Penetrations or openings in construction assemblies for piping, electrical devices, recessed cabinets, bathtubs, soffits or heating, ventilating or exhaust ducts shall be sealed, lined, insulated or otherwise treated to maintain the required ratings.</p>
<p><b>1207.8 Impact sound insulation.</b> All acoustically rated separating floor-ceiling assemblies shall provide impact sound insulation equal to that required to meet a IIC rating of 50 based on laboratory tests as defined in ASTM E 492 and E 989. Field-tested assemblies shall meet a field impact insulation class (FIIC) rating of 45 for both occupied and unoccupied units as defined in ASTM E 1007 and E 989, with the exception that the measured impact sound pressure levels shall not be normalized to a standard amount of absorption in the receiving room.</p>
<p>Floor coverings may be included in the assembly to obtain the required ratings. These coverings must be retained as a permanent part of the assembly and may be replaced only by other floor coverings that provide the required impact sound insulation.</p>
<p><b>1207.9 Tested assemblies.</b> Laboratory-tested wall or floor-ceiling designs having STC or IIC ratings of 50 or more may be used by the building official to determine compliance with this section during plan review phase. Field tests shall be required by the building official when evidence of sound leaks or flanking paths is noted, or when the separating assembly is not built according to the approved design.</p>
<p>Generic sound transmission control systems as listed in the Catalog of STC and IIC Ratings for Wall and Floor-Ceiling Assemblies, as published by the Office of Noise Control, California Department of Health Services, or the Fire Resistance Design Manual, as published by the Gypsum Association, may be used to evaluate construction assemblies for their sound transmission properties. Other tests from recognized laboratories may also be used. When ratings for essentially similar  field testing may be used to demonstrate that the building complies with this section.</p>
<p>For field testing, rooms should ideally be large and reverberant for reliable measurements to be made in all test bands. This is often not possible for bathrooms, kitchens, hallways or rooms with large amounts of sound-absorptive materials. Field test results should, however, report the measured values in all bands, noting those which do not meet relevant ASTM criteria for diffusion.</p>
<p>It should be noted that STC ratings do not adequately characterize the sound insulation of construction assemblies when the intruding noise is predominantly low-pitched, as is often produced by amplified music or by large pieces of mechanical equipment.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the transmission of impact sound from a standardized tapping machine may vary considerably for a given design due to differences in specimen size, flanking transmission through associated structure and the acoustical response of the room below. Laboratory IIC values should therefore be used with caution when estimating the performance of hard-surfaced floors in the field. Additionally, IIC ratings may not always be adequate to characterize the subjectively annoying creak or boom generated by footfalls on a lumber floor.</p>
<p><b>1207.10 Certification.</b> Field testing, when required, shall be done under the supervision of a person experienced in the field of acoustical testing and engineering, who shall forward test results to the building official showing that the sound isolation requirements stated above have been met. Documentation of</p>
<p>field test results should generally follow the requirements outlined in relevant ASTM standards.</p>
<p class="b"><b>1207.11 Exterior sound transmission control.</b></p>
<p><b>1207.11.1 Application.</b> Consistent with local land-use standards, residential structures located in noise critical areas, such as proximity to highways, county roads, city streets, railroads, rapid transit lines, airports or industrial areas, shall be designed to prevent the intrusion of exterior noises beyond prescribed levels. Proper design shall include, but shall not be limited to, orientation of the residential structure, setbacks, shielding and sound insulation of the building itself.</p>
<p><b>1207.11.2 Allowable interior noise levels.</b> Interior noise levels attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed 45 db in any habitable room. The noise metric shall be either the day-night average sound level (Ldn) or the community noise equivalent level (CNEL), consistent with the noise element of the local general plan.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Ldn is the preferred metric for implementing these standards. Worst-case noise levels, either existing or future, shall be used as the basis for determining compliance with this section. Future noise levels shall be predicted for a period of at least 10 years from the time of building permit application.</p>
<p><b>1207.11.3 Airport noise sources.</b> Residential structures to be located where the annual Ldn or CNEL (as defined in  California Code of Regulations) exceeds 60 db shall require an acoustical analysis showing that the proposed design will achieve prescribed allowable interior level. For public-use airports or heliports, the Ldn or CNEL shall be determined from the airport land-use plan prepared by the county wherein the airport is located. For military bases, the Ldn shall be determined from the facility Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) plan. For all other airports or heliports, or public-use airports or heliports for which a land-use plan has not been developed, the Ldn or CNEL shall be determined from the noise element of the general plan of the local jurisdiction.</p>
<p>When aircraft noise is not the only significant source, noise levels from all sources shall be added to determine the composite site noise level.</p>
<p><b>1207.11.4 Other noise sources.</b> Residential structures to be located where the Ldn or CNEL exceeds 60 db shall require an acoustical analysis showing that the proposed design will limit exterior noise to the prescribed allowable interior level. The noise element of the local general plan shall be used to the greatest extent possible to identify sites with noise levels potentially greater than 60 db.</p>
<p><b>1207.12 Compliance.</b> Evidence of compliance shall consist of submittal of an acoustical analysis report, prepared under the supervision of a person experienced in the field of acoustical engineering, with the application for a building permit. The report shall show topographical relationships of noise sources and dwelling sites, identification of noise sources and their characteristics, predicted noise spectra and levels at the exterior of the proposed dwelling structure considering present and future land usage, basis for the prediction (measured or obtained from published data), noise attenuation measures to be applied, and an analysis of the noise insulation effectiveness of the proposed construction showing that the prescribed interior noise level requirements are met.</p>
<p>If interior allowable noise levels are met by requiring that windows be unopenable or closed, the design for the structure must also specify a ventilation or air-conditioning system to provide a habitable interior environment. The ventilation system must not compromise the dwelling unit or guest room noise reduction.</p>
<p><b>1207.13 Field testing.</b> When inspection indicates that the construction is not in accordance with the approved design, or that the noise reduction is compromised due to sound leaks or flanking paths, field testing may be required. A test report showing compliance or noncompliance with prescribed interior allowable levels shall be submitted to the building official.</p>
<p>Measurements of outdoor sound levels shall generally follow the guidelines in ASTM E 1014.</p>
<p>Field measurements of the A-weighted airborne sound insulation of buildings from exterior sources shall generally follow the guidelines in ASTM E 966.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this standard, sound level differences measured in unoccupied units shall be normalized to a receiving room reverberation time of one-half second. Sound level differences measured in occupied units shall not be normalized to a standard reverberation time.</p>
