<p>When a request for alternate means of protection involves hazardous materials, the authority having jurisdiction may consider implementation of the findings and recommendations identified in a Risk Management Plan (RMP) developed in accordance with Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Article 3.</p>
<p>Approved of a request for use of an alternative material, assembly of materials, equipment, method of construction, method of installation of equipment or means of protection made pursuant to these provisions shall be limited to the particular case covered by request and shall not be construed as establishing any precedent for any future request.</p>
<p><b>1.11.2.5 Appeals.</b> When a request for an alternate means of protection has been denied by the enforcing agency, the applicant may file a written appeal to the State Fire Marshal for consideration of the applicant&#39;s proposal. In considering such appeal, the State Fire Marshal may seek the advice of the State Board of Fire Services. The State Fire Marshal shall, after considering all of the facts presented, including any recommendations of the State Board of Fire Services, determine if the proposal is for the purposes intended, at least equivalent to the specified in these regulations in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety, and shall transmit such findings and any recommendations to the applicant and to the enforcing agency.</p>

<p>expected to explode virtually instantaneously when a small portion is subjected to fire, severe concussion, impact, the impulse of an initiating agent or the effect of a considerable discharge of energy from without. Materials that react in this manner represent a mass explosion hazard. Such an explosive will normally cause severe structural damage to adjacent objects. Explosive propagation could occur immediately to other items of ammunition and explosives stored sufficiently close to and not adequately protected from the initially exploding pile with a time interval short enough so that two or more quantities must be considered as one for quantity-distance purposes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Classify these homes as a permitted use of residential property for zoning purposes.</li>
<li>Grant a nondiscretionary permit to use a lot zoned for a single-family dwelling to any large family day-care home that complies with local ordinances prescribing reasonable standards, restrictions and requirements concerning spacing and concentration, traffic control, parking and noise control relating to such homes, and complies with subdivision (d) and any regulations adopted by the state fire marshal pursuant to that subdivision. Any noise standards shall be consistent with local noise ordinances implementing the noise element of the general plan and shall take into consideration the noise level generated by children. The permit issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be granted by the zoning administrator, if any, or if there is no zoning administrator by the person or persons designated by the planning agency to grant such permits, upon the certification without a hearing.</li>
<li>Require any large family day-care home to apply for a permit to use a lot zoned for single-family dwellings. The zoning administrator, if any, or if there is no zoning administrator, the person or persons designated by the planning agency to handle the use permits shall review and decide the applications. The use permit shall be granted if the large family day care home complies with local ordinances, if any, prescribing reasonable standards, restrictions and requirements concerning spacing and concentration, traffic control, parking and noise control relating to such homes, and complies with subdivision (d) and any regulations adopted by the state fire marshal pursuant to that subdivision. <br />Any noise standards shall be consistent with local noise ordinances implementing the noise element of the general plan and shall take into consideration the noise levels generated by children. <br />The local government shall process any required permit as economically as possible, and fees charged for review shall not exceed the costs of the review and permit process. Not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the decision will be made on the application, the zoning administrator or person designated to handle such use permits shall give notice of the proposed use by mail or delivery to all owners shown on the last equalized assessment roll as owning real property within a 100-foot radius of the exterior boundaries of the proposed large family day care home. No hearing on the application for a permit issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be held before a decision is made unless a hearing is requested by the applicant or other affected person. The applicant or other affected person may appeal the decision. The appellant shall pay the cost, if any of the appeal.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A large family day-care home shall not be subject to the provisions of Division 13(commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code.</li>
<li>Use of a single-family dwelling for the purposes of a large family day-care home shall not constitute a change of occupancy for purposes of Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 17910) of Division 13 (State Housing Law), or for purposes of local building and fire codes.</li>
<li>Large family day-care homes shall be considered as single-family residences for the purposes of the State Uniform Building Standards Code and local building and fire codes, except with respect to any additional standards specifically designed to promote the fire and life safety of the children in these homes adopted by the State Fire Marshal pursuant to this subdivision.</li>

<a name="s703" /><h2>SECTION 703 <br />FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS AND FIRE TESTS</h2>
<p><b>703.1 Scope.</b> Materials prescribed herein for <i>fire resistance</i> shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.</p>
<div class="single"><span class="single-symbol"></span>
<p><b>703.2 Fire-resistance ratings.</b> The <i>fire-resistance rating</i> of building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined in accordance with the test procedures set forth in ASTM E 119 or UL 263 or in accordance with Section 703.3. Where materials, systems or devices that have not been tested as part of a fire-resistance-rated assembly are incorporated into the building element, component or assembly, sufficient data shall be made available to the <i>building official</i> to show that the required <i>fire-resistance rating</i> is not reduced. Materials and methods of construction used to protect joints and penetrations in fire-resistance-rated building elements, components or assemblies shall not reduce the required <i>fire-resistance rating.</i></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Exception:</b> In determining the <i>fire-resistance rating</i> of exterior bearing walls, compliance with the ASTM E 119 or UL 263 criteria for unexposed surface temperature rise and ignition of cotton waste due to passage of flame or gases is required only for a period of time corresponding to the required <i>fire-resistance rating</i> of an exterior nonbearing wall with the same <i>fire separation distance,</i> and in a building of the same group. When the <i>fire-resistance rating</i> determined in accordance with this exception exceeds the <i>fire-resistance rating</i> determined in accordance with ASTM E 119 or UL 263, the fire exposure time period, water pressure and application duration criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM E 119 or UL 263 shall be based upon the <i>fire-resistance rating</i> determined in accordance with this exception.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><span class="single"><span class="single-symbol"></span><b>703.2.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction.</b> Interior walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the assigned <i>fire-resistance rating</i> shall be the shortest duration obtained from the two tests conducted in compliance with ASTM E 119 or UL 263. When evidence is furnished to show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to the furnace, subject to acceptance of the <i>building official,</i> the wall need not be subjected to tests from the opposite side (see Section 705.5 for <i>exterior walls</i>).</span></p>
<p><b>703.2.2 Combustible components.</b> Combustible aggregates are permitted in gypsum and portland cement concrete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated construction. Any component material or admixture is permitted in assemblies if the resulting tested assembly meets the fire-resistance test requirements of this code.</p>
<a name="p170" /><span class="page">170</span>
<p><span class="single"><span class="single-symbol"></span><b>703.2.3 Restrained classification.</b> Fire-resistance-rated assemblies tested under ASTME 119 or UL 263 shall not be considered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory to the <i>building official</i> is furnished by the <i>registered design professional</i> showing that the construction qualifies for a restrained classification in accordance with ASTM E 119 or UL 263. Restrained construction shall be identified on the plans.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="single"><span class="single-symbol"></span>
<p><b>703.3 Alternative methods for determining fire resistance.</b> The application of any of the alternative methods listed in this section shall be based on the fire exposure and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E 119 or UL 263. The required <i>fire resistance</i> of a building element, component or assembly shall be permitted to be established by any of the following methods or procedures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fire-resistance designs documented in sources.</li>

<p><b>1105A.1 General.</b> Garages, carports and other parking facilities, which are accessory to covered multifamily dwelling units, shall be accessible as required in Section 1109A.</p>
<a name="s1106A" /><h2>SECTION 1106A <br />SITE AND BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p><b>1106A.1 General.</b> Covered multifamily dwelling with elevators shall be designed and constructed to provide at least one accessible entrance on an accessible route, regardless of terrain or unusual characteristics of the site. Covered multifamily dwellings without elevators shall be designed and constructed to provide at least one accessible entrance on an accessible route unless terrain or unusual characteristics of the site prevent an accessible route based on the conditions listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li><b> Accessible entrance.</b> Regardless of site considerations described in Section 1150A, an accessible entrance on an accessible route is required when there is an elevator connecting the parking area with the dwelling units on a ground floor. (In this case, those dwelling units on the ground floor served by an elevator, and at least one of each type of public- and common-use areas, would be subject to these requirements.)</li>
<li><b>Elevator building.</b> When a building elevator or elevators are provided as a means of access to dwelling units other than dwelling units on a ground floor (see Section 1104A.2), the building is an elevator building. all dwelling units become covered multifamily dwellings in that building. the elevator in that building must provide accessibility to all dwelling units in the building, regardless of the slope of the natural terrain. For multistory dwelling <span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>units in buildings with one or more elevators, see Section</span> 1102A.3.2. <br />
<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> Where a building elevator is provided only as means of creating an accessible route to covered multifamily dwelling units on a ground floor, the building is not considered to be an elevator building, only dwelling units located on the ground floor shall be required to comply with this chapter.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><b> Elevated walkway.</b> When an elevated walkway is planned between a building entrance and a vehicular or pedestrian arrival point, and the planned walkway has a slope no greater than 10 percent (1 unit vertical in 10 units horizontal), the floor being served by the elevated walkway becomes a ground floor and accessibility to all dwellings on that ground floor is required. <br />
<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> Since the planned walkway meets the 10 percent slope criterion, it is required to provided an accessible route to the entrance, and the slope of the walkway must be reduced to 1 unit vertical in 12 units horizontal (8.33 percent slope) maximum.</p></blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p><b>1106A.2 Site impracticality.</b> for tests to determine site impracticality due to terrain considerations in nonelevator buildings, see Section 1150A.</p>

<p><b>1150A.1 General.</b> Covered multifamily dwellings in buildings without an elevator, located on sites with difficult terrain conditions or unusual characteristics, may employ the site impracticality tests in this division for determining the accessibility and adaptability provisions required by this chapter.</p>
<p>Except as provided for in Section 1102A.3.1, the provisions of this section do not apply to multistory dwelling units in nonelevator buildings.</p>

<tr><td><b><span class="underline">SINGLE BUILDING WITH ONE COMMON (LOBBY) ENTRANCE</span></b> <br />The following may only be used for determining required access to covered multifamily dwelling units, in a single building with one common (lobby) entrance, located on a site with difficult terrain conditions or unusual characteristics: <br />All ground floor units in nonelevator buildings shall be adaptable and on an accessible route unless an accessible route to the common (lobby) entrance is not required as determined by Test No. 1, Individual Building Test, or Test No. 3, Unusual Characteristics Test, as described in this section. <br />Sites where either Test No. 1 or Test No. 3 is used and it is determined that an accessible route to the common (lobby) entrance is not required, at least 20 percent of the ground floor dwelling units shall comply with Division IV, and all remaining ground floor dwelling units shall comply with the features listed in Section 1150A.2 unless exempted by Test No. 3, Unusual Characteristics Test. <br />Test No. 1&#8212;Individual Building Test may only be used if the site has terrain over 15 percent slope. <br />Test No. 3&#8212;Unusual Characteristics Test may be used if applicable.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><b>Provisions to Test Nos. 1 and 2.</b> Where a building elevator is provided only as means of creating an accessible route to covered multifamily dwelling units on a ground floor, the building is not considered to be an elevator building for purposes of this code; hence, only the ground floor dwelling units would be covered.</p>
<p class="b">TEST NO. 1&#8212;INDIVIDUAL BUILDING TEST</p>
<p>It is not required by this code to provide an accessible route when the terrain of the site is such that both of the following apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>The slopes of the undisturbed site measured between the planned entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance exceed 15 percent; and</li>
<li>The slopes of the planned finished grade measured between the entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance also exceed 15 percent.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, the slope for the purposes of Test No. 1 will be measured to the closest vehicular or pedestrian arrival point.</p>
<p>For purposes of these requirements, vehicular or pedestrian arrival points include public or resident parking areas, public transportation stops, passenger loading zones and public streets or sidewalks. To determine site impracticality, the slope would be measured at ground level from the point of the planned entrance on a straight line to (1) each vehicular or pedestrian arrival point that is within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, or (2) if there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within the specified area, the vehicular or pedestrian arrival point closest to the planned entrance. In the case of sidewalks, the closest point to the planned entrance will be where a public sidewalk entering the site interests with the walk to the entrance. In the case of resident parking areas, the closest point to the planned entrance will be measured from the entry point to the parking area that is located closest to the planned entrance.</p>
<p class="b">TEST NO. 2&#8212;SITE ANALYSIS TEST</p>
<p>For a site having multiple buildings, or a site with a single building with multiple entrances, it is not required to provide an accessible route to all ground floor units under the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the percentage of the total buildable area of the undisturbed site with a natural grade less than 10-percent slope. The analysis of the existing slope (before grading) shall be done on a topographic survey with 2-foot (610 mm) contour intervals with slope determination made between each successive interval. The accuracy of the slope analysis shall be certified by a licensed engineer, landscape architect, architect or surveyor.</li>
<li>Determine the requirement of providing an accessible route to planned multifamily dwellings based on the topography of the existing natural terrain. The minimum percentage of ground floor units required on an accessible route shall equal the percentage of the total buildable area (not restricted-use areas) of the undisturbed site with an existing natural grade of less than 10-percent slope. In no case shall less than 20 percent of the ground floor dwelling units be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Division IV.</li>
<li>In addition to the percentage established in paragraph (2), all additional ground floor units in a building, or ground floor units served by a particular entrance, that fall within an 8.33-percent slope between their planned entrances and an arrival point <br />
<a name="p409" /><span class="page">409</span> <br />shall be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Division IV.</li>
<li>All additional ground floor units in a building, or ground floor units served by a particular entrance, not on an accessible route shall comply with the features listed in Section 1150A.2.</li>
</ol>
<p class="b">TEST NO. 3&#8212;UNUSUAL CHARACTERISTICS TEST</p>
<p><span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>Unusual characteristics include sites located in a state or</span> federally designated floodplain or coastal high-hazard areas and sites subject to other similar requirements of law or code that require the lowest floor or the lowest structural member of the lowest floor to be designed to a specified level at or above the base flood elevation. An accessible route to a building entrance is impractical due to unusual characteristics of the site when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The original site characteristics result in a difference in finished grade elevation exceeding 30 inches (762 mm) and 10 percent measured between an entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance; or</li>
<li>If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, the unusual characteristics result in a difference in finished grade elevation exceeding 30 inches (762 mm) and 10 percent measured between an entrance and the closest vehicular or pedestrian arrival point.</li>
</ol>
<p class="b">1150A.2 Additional requirements for Section 1150A.</p>
<p>All other ground floor dwelling units in nonelevator buildings shall be made to comply with the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab bar reinforcement: see Section 1134A.</li>
<li>Thirty-two inch (813 mm) clear door interior opening width: see Section 1132A.3.</li>
<li>Lever hardware: see Section 1132A.8.</li>
<li>Door signal devices: see Section 1132A.10.</li>
<li>Clear space by doors: see Chapters 10 and 11A.</li>
<li>Minimum 15-inch (381 mm) water closet seat height: see Section 1134A.7, Item 3.</li>
<li>Electrical receptacle outlet height: see Section 1136A.</li>
<li>Lighting and environmental control height: see Section 1136A.</li>
<li>Faucet controls: see Section 1134A.8, Item 7.</li>
<li>Water closet, bathtub and lavatory minimum space requirements: see Section 1134A.</li>
<li>Removable cabinets under the kitchen sink counter area: see Section 1133A.3.</li>

<p class="b">Division IV&#8212;ACCESSIBILITY FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS</p>
<a name="s1134B" /><h2>SECTION 1134B <br />ACCESSIBILITY FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS</h2>
<p><b>1134B.1 Scope.</b> The provisions of this division apply to renovation, structural repair, alteration and additions to existing buildings, including those identified as historic buildings. This division identifies minimum standards for removing architectural barriers, and providing and maintaining accessibility to existing buildings and their related facilities.</p>
<p>No renovation, structural repair, alteration or addition shall be undertaken which decreases or has the effect of decreasing accessibility or usability of a building or facility below the requirements for new construction at the time of renovation, structural repair, alteration or addition.</p>
<p><span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span><b>1134B.2 General.</b> When alterations, structural repairs or additions are made to existing buildings or facilities, they shall</span> comply with all provisions of Division I&#8212;New Buildings, except as modified by this division. These requirements shall apply only to the area of specific alteration, structural repair or addition and shall include those areas listed below:</p>
<div>
<p><b>1134B.2.1</b> A primary entrance to the building or facility and the primary path of travel to the specific area of alteration, structural repair or addition, and sanitary facilities, drinking fountains, signs and public telephones serving the area.</p>
<blockquote><p class="b">Exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the total construction cost of alterations, structural repairs or additions does not exceed a valuation threshold of $50,000, based on January 1981, &#8220;ENR US20 Cities&#8221; Average Construction Cost Index of 3372.02 (Engineering News Record, McGraw Hill Publishing Company), and the enforcing agency finds that compliance with this code creates an unreasonable hardship, compliance shall be limited to the actual work of the project. The enforcing agency shall annually update the valuation threshold to a current amount based on the increase in the index since the last figure used. (For example, the January 2010 amount is $128,410.86.) For purposes of this exception, an unreasonable hardship exists where the cost of providing an accessible entrance, path of travel, sanitary facilities, public phones and drinking fountains is disproportionate to the cost of the project; that is, where it exceeds 20 percent of the cost of the project without these features. Where the cost of alterations necessary to make these features fully accessible is disproportionate, access shall be provided to the extent that it can be without incurring disproportionate cost. In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access in the following order:
<ol>
<li>An accessible entrance;</li>
<li>An accessible route to the altered area;</li>
<li>At least one accessible restroom for each sex;</li>
<li>Accessible telephones;</li>
<li>Accessible drinking fountains; and</li>
<li>When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage and alarms. <br />The obligation to provide access may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking. If an area has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area or a different area on the same path of travel are undertaken within three years of the original alterations to the areas on that path of travel during the preceding three-year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate. Only alterations undertaken after January 26, 1992, shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Certain types of privately funded, multistory buildings and facilities were formerly exempt from accessibility requirements above and below the first floor under this code, but as of the effective date of this regulation are no longer exempt due to more restrictive provisions in the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. In alteration projects involving buildings and facilities previously approved and built without elevators, areas above and below the ground floor are subject to the 20-percent disproportionality provisions described in Exception 1, above, even if the value of the project exceeds the valuation threshold in Exception 1. The types of buildings and facilities are:
<ol>
<li>Office buildings and passenger vehicle service stations of three stories or more and 3,000 or more square feet (279 m<sup>2</sup>) per floor.</li>
<li>Offices of physicians and surgeons.</li>
<li>Shopping centers.</li>
<li>Other buildings and facilities three stories or more and 3,000 or more square feet (279 m<sup>2</sup>) per floor if a reasonable portion of services sought and used by the public is available on the accessible level. <br />For the general privately funded multistory building exception applicable to new construction and alterations, see Section 1103B.1, Exception 2. <br />The elevator exception set forth in this section does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements in this code. For example, floors above or below
<a name="p515" /><span class="page">515</span>the accessible ground floor must meet the requirements of this section except for elevator service. If toilet or bathing facilities are provided on a level not served by an elevator, then toilet or bathing facilities must be provided on the accessible ground floor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Alterations, structural repairs or additions consisting of one or more of the following shall be limited to the actual work of the project:
<ol>
<li>Altering one building entrance to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li>Altering one existing toilet facility to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li>Altering existing elevators to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li>Altering existing steps to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li>Altering existing handrails to meet accessibility requirements.</li>
<li><span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>Alteration solely for the purpose of barrier removal undertaken pursuant to the</span> requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-336, 28 <span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>C.F.R., Section 36.304) or the accessibility</span> requirements of this code as those requirements or regulations now exist or are hereafter amended, including the following:
<ol>
<li>Installing ramps.</li>
<li>Making curb cuts in sidewalks and entrance.</li>
<li>Repositioning shelves.</li>
<li>Rearranging tables, chairs, vending machines, display racks, and other furniture.</li>
<li>Repositioning telephones.</li>
<li>Adding raised markings on elevator control buttons.</li>
<li>Installing flashing alarm lights.</li>
<li>Widening doors.</li>
<li>Installing offset hinges to widen doorways.</li>
<li>Eliminating a turnstile or providing an alternative accessible path.</li>
<li>Installing accessible door hardware.</li>
<li>Installing grab bars in toilet stalls.</li>
<li>Rearranging toilet partitions to increase maneuvering space.</li>
<li>Insulating lavatory pipes under sinks to prevent burns.</li>
<li>Installing a raised toilet seat.</li>
<li>Installing a full-length bathroom mirror.</li>
<li>Repositioning the paper towel dispenser in a bathroom.</li>
<li>Creating designated accessible parking spaces.</li>
<li>Installing an accessible paper cup dispenser at an existing in-accessible water fountain.</li>
<li>Removing high-pile, low-density carpeting.</li>
<li>Installing vehicle hand controls.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Altering existing parking lots by resurfacing and/or restriping.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Projects which consist only of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, reroofing, electrical work not involving placement of switches and receptacles, cosmetic work that does not affect items regulated by this code, such as painting, equipment not considered to be a part of the architecture of the building or area, such as computer terminals, office equipment, etc., are not considered alteration projects for the purposes of accessibility for persons with disabilities and shall not be subject to this code unless they affect the usability of the building or facility. For the purposes of this section, the term &#8220;construction cost&#8221; does not include building permit fees or discretionary permit fees. <br />The only purpose of this exception is to exclude projects from activating the provisions of this section. The exceptions are not intended to relieve projects from complying with other applicable provisions of this code (e.g., replacement of carpet does not activate the provisions of this section; however, it still must comply with Section 1124B.3).</li>
</ol>

<p><b>1134B.2.2</b> Where it is technically infeasible in the area of an alteration to make existing toilet facilities code compliant and to install separate toilet facilities for each sex, then the installation of at least one unisex toilet/facility per floor being altered, located in the same area as existing toilet facilities, will be permitted. Such a facility shall meet the requirements of Section 1115B.3.2.</p>
<p><b>1134B.2.3</b> <span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>If alterations of single elements, when considered together, amount to an alteration of a room or space in a building or facility, the entire room or space shall be made accessible.</span></p>

<a name="s1101C" /><h2>SECTION 1101C <br />CARD-READER DEVICES AT FUEL-DISPENSING EQUIPMENT</h2>
<div class="two-column">
<p><b>1101C.1 General.</b> Notwithstanding other requirements in the California Building Code, only the requirements and additional definitions in this section shall apply to card-reading devices in motor vehicle fuel facilities, except that<span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span> administrative requirements which are found in Chapter 1&#8212;California Administration Division I still apply.</span></p>
<p>For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<p><b>ACCESSIBLE.</b> See Chapter 11A, Section 1107A.1-A and Chapter 11B, Section 1102B.</p>
<p><b>ACCESSIBLE ELEMENT.</b> See Chapter 11B, Section 1102B.</p>
<p><b>ALTERNATE CARD READER</b> shall be defined in this section as functionally equal card reader and control directly attached to or an integral part of the fuel dispenser in addition to the primary card reader, which is an integral part of the dispenser.</p>
<p><b>FREE-STANDING PEDESTAL</b> is a card-reading device which controls one or more remote fuel dispensers that have no card readers as an integral part of the fuel dispenser.</p>
<p><b>GRADE (Adjacent Ground Elevation).</b> See Chapter 2, Section 202.</p>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL OF ACCESSIBILITY.</b> See Chapter 11A, Section 1107A.9-I and Chapter 11B, Section 1102B.</p>
<p><b>LEVEL ACCESSIBLE AREA,</b> for the purpose of this section, shall mean a slope of not more than one unit vertical in 50 units horizontal (2-percent slope) in front of the dispensing device; however, the slope may extend to one unit vertical in 20 units horizontal (5-percent slope) where the enforcing authority determines that, due to unusual site conditions, the 2-percent slope is not obtainable.</p>
<p><b>LEVEL AREA.</b> See Chapter 11A, Section 1107A.12-L and Chapter 11B, Section 1102B.</p>
<p><span class="great"><span class="great-symbol"></span></span></p>
<p><b>RECOMMEND.</b> See Chapter 2, Section 202.</p>
<p><b>TYPE OF MOTOR FUEL</b> shall mean gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, methanol, electricity or ethanol.</p>
<a name="s1102C" /><h2>SECTION 1102C <br />APPLICATION</h2>
<p>This section shall apply to equipment located at the following facilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>New motor vehicle fuel facilities.</li>
<li>Existing motor vehicle fuel facilities built before the effective date of this section where:
<ol>
<li>Remodeling or reconstruction includes removal and replacement of one or more islands and associated piping and tank(s); or</li>
<li>Remodeling includes reconstruction or removal and replacement of fuel islands at facilities that provide free-standing pedestal card readers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<a name="s1103C" /><h2>SECTION 1103C <br />NUMBER OF ACCESSIBLE CARD-READING DEVICES REQUIRED</h2>
<p>Where only one card-reading device is installed for use with any type of motor fuel, it shall meet the required features of this section. When more than one card-reading location is available for a specific type of motor fuel, a minimum of two for that type shall have the accessible features of this section.</p>
<a name="s1104C" /><h2>SECTION 1104C <br />REQUIRED FEATURES</h2>
<p>Card-reading devices at motor vehicle fuel facilities shall be accessible by complying with only the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The highest operable part of each primary or alternate card reader shall be no more than 54 inches (1372 mm) measured from the base of the fuel dispenser. Where card readers are located on free-standing pedestals, the card-reading control function shall be no more than 54 inches (1372 mm) above an accessible level area which <span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>is served by an accessible route of travel.</span>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Exception:</b> If an enforcing agency requires that fuel dispenser or card-reading devices be placed in a manner where the card-reading device exceeds the requirements described herein, the provisions of Section 1104C do not apply. Any enforcing agency having jurisdiction over retail fueling facilities may not require islands or impose other regulations which conflict with this section, unless the agency documents and justifies the specific necessity for such a rule or ordinance and complies with the requirements of Health and Safety Code Section 18941.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>An accessible route of travel shall be provided to the base</span> of all fuel dispensers required to meet the provisions of this section. Such fuel dispensers shall be mounted on the accessible level area.</li>
<li>An accessible level area shall be provided, which is minimally 30 inches by 48 inches (762 mm by 1219 mm) level and clear. This area shall be provided within 10 inches (254 mm) in plan view of the face of the controls and shall be unobstructed by any features, except pump nozzles and hoses, with the long side of this space parallel to and centered [plus or minus 9 inches (229 mm)] with the face of the card-reader controls. See Figures 11C-1 and 11C-2.

<h2><span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>SECTION 1207 <i>[HCD 1&#38; HCD 2]</i> <br />SOUND TRANSMISSION</span></h2>
<div class="i">
<p><b>1207.1 Purpose and scope.</b> The purpose of this section is to establish uniform minimum noise insulation performance standards to protect persons within hotels, motels, dormitories, apartment houses and dwellings other than detached single-family dwellings from the effects of excessive noise, including, but not limited to, hearing loss or impairment and interference with speech and sleep. This section shall apply to all buildings for which applications for building permits were made subsequent to August 22, 1974.</p>
<p><b>1207.2 Definitions.</b> The following special definitions shall apply to this section:</p>
<p><b>SOUND TRANSMISSION CLASS (STC)</b> is a single-number rating used to compare walls, floor-ceiling assemblies and doors for their sound-insulating properties with respect to speech and small household appliance noise. The STC is derived from laboratory measurements of sound transmission loss across a series of 16 test bands.</p>
<p>Laboratory STC ratings should be used to the greatest extent possible in determining that the design complies with this section.</p>
<p><b>FIELD SOUND TRANSMISSION CLASS (FSTC)</b> is a single-number rating similar to STC, except that the transmission loss values used to derive the FSTC are measured in the field. All sound transmitted from the source room to the receiving room is assumed to be through the separating wall or floor-ceiling assembly.</p>
<p>This section does not require determination of the FSTC, and field-measured values of noise reduction should not be reported as transmission loss.</p>
<p><b>IMPACT INSULATION CLASS (IIC)</b> is a single-number rating used to compare the effectiveness of floor-ceiling assemblies in providing reduction of impact-generated sounds such as footsteps. The IIC is derived from laboratory measurements of impact sound pressure level across a series of 16 test bands using a standardized tapping machine. Laboratory IIC ratings should be used to the greatest extent possible in determining that the design complies with this section.</p>
<p><b>FIELD IMPACT INSULATION CLASS (FIIC)</b> is a single-number rating similar to the IIC, except that the impact sound pressure levels are measured in the field</p>
<p><b>NOISE ISOLATION CLASS (NIC)</b> is a single-number rating derived from measured values of noise reduction between two enclosed spaces that are connected by one or more paths. The NIC is not adjusted or normalized to a standard reverberation time.</p>
<p><b>NORMALIZED NOISE ISOLATION CLASS (NNIC)</b> is a single-number rating similar to the NIC, except that the measured noise reduction values are normalized to a reverberation time of one-half second.</p>
<p><b>NORMALIZED A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL DIFFERENCE (Dn)</b> means for a specified source room sound spectrum, Dn is the difference, in decibels, between the average sound levels produced in two rooms after adjustment to the expected acoustical conditions when the receiving room under test is normally furnished.</p>
<p><b>DAY-NIGHT AVERAGE SOUND LEVEL (Ldn)</b> is the A-weighted equivalent continuous sound exposure level for a 24-hour period with a 10 db adjustment added to sound levels occurring during nighttime hours (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.).</p>
<p><b>COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL (CNEL)</b> is a metric similar to the Ldn, except that a 5 db adjustment is added to the equivalent continuous sound exposure level for evening hours (7 p.m. to 10 p.m.) in addition to the 10 db nighttime adjustment used in the Ldn.</p>
<p><b>1207.3 Relevant standards.</b> The current edition of the following standards is generally applicable for determining compliance with this section. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) at 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohoken, PA, 19428-2959.</p>

<p><b>1207.8 Impact sound insulation.</b> All acoustically rated separating floor-ceiling assemblies shall provide impact sound insulation equal to that required to meet a IIC rating of 50 based on laboratory tests as defined in ASTM E 492 and E 989. Field-tested assemblies shall meet a field impact insulation class (FIIC) rating of 45 for both occupied and unoccupied units as defined in ASTM E 1007 and E 989, with the exception that the measured impact sound pressure levels shall not be normalized to a standard amount of absorption in the receiving room.</p>
<p>Floor coverings may be included in the assembly to obtain the required ratings. These coverings must be retained as a permanent part of the assembly and may be replaced only by other floor coverings that provide the required impact sound insulation.</p>
<p><b>1207.9 Tested assemblies.</b> Laboratory-tested wall or floor-ceiling designs having STC or IIC ratings of 50 or more may be used by the building official to determine compliance with this section during plan review phase. Field tests shall be required by the building official when evidence of sound leaks or flanking paths is noted, or when the separating assembly is not built according to the approved design.</p>
<p>Generic sound transmission control systems as listed in the Catalog of STC and IIC Ratings for Wall and Floor-Ceiling Assemblies, as published by the Office of Noise Control, California Department of Health Services, or the Fire Resistance Design Manual, as published by the Gypsum Association, may be used to evaluate construction assemblies for their sound transmission properties. Other tests from recognized laboratories may also be used. When ratings for essentially similar <span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>assemblies differ, and when ratings are below STC or IIC 50,</span> field testing may be used to demonstrate that the building complies with this section.</p>
<p>For field testing, rooms should ideally be large and reverberant for reliable measurements to be made in all test bands. This is often not possible for bathrooms, kitchens, hallways or rooms with large amounts of sound-absorptive materials. Field test results should, however, report the measured values in all bands, noting those which do not meet relevant ASTM criteria for diffusion.</p>
<p>It should be noted that STC ratings do not adequately characterize the sound insulation of construction assemblies when the intruding noise is predominantly low-pitched, as is often produced by amplified music or by large pieces of mechanical equipment.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the transmission of impact sound from a standardized tapping machine may vary considerably for a given design due to differences in specimen size, flanking transmission through associated structure and the acoustical response of the room below. Laboratory IIC values should therefore be used with caution when estimating the performance of hard-surfaced floors in the field. Additionally, IIC ratings may not always be adequate to characterize the subjectively annoying creak or boom generated by footfalls on a lumber floor.</p>
<p><b>1207.10 Certification.</b> Field testing, when required, shall be done under the supervision of a person experienced in the field of acoustical testing and engineering, who shall forward test results to the building official showing that the sound isolation requirements stated above have been met. Documentation of</p>

<div>
<p><b>1207.11.1 Application.</b> Consistent with local land-use standards, residential structures located in noise critical areas, such as proximity to highways, county roads, city streets, railroads, rapid transit lines, airports or industrial areas, shall be designed to prevent the intrusion of exterior noises beyond prescribed levels. Proper design shall include, but shall not be limited to, orientation of the residential structure, setbacks, shielding and sound insulation of the building itself.</p>
<p><b>1207.11.2 Allowable interior noise levels.</b> Interior noise levels attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed 45 db in any habitable room. The noise metric shall be either the day-night average sound level (Ldn) or the community noise equivalent level (CNEL), consistent with the noise element of the local general plan.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> Ldn is the preferred metric for implementing these standards. Worst-case noise levels, either existing or future, shall be used as the basis for determining compliance with this section. Future noise levels shall be predicted for a period of at least 10 years from the time of building permit application.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>1207.11.3 Airport noise sources.</b> Residential structures to be located where the annual Ldn or CNEL (as defined in <span class="double"><span class="double-symbol"></span>Title 21, Division 2.5, Chapter 6, Article 1, Section 5001,</span> California Code of Regulations) exceeds 60 db shall require an acoustical analysis showing that the proposed design will achieve prescribed allowable interior level. For public-use airports or heliports, the Ldn or CNEL shall be determined from the airport land-use plan prepared by the county wherein the airport is located. For military bases, the Ldn shall be determined from the facility Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) plan. For all other airports or heliports, or public-use airports or heliports for which a land-use plan has not been developed, the Ldn or CNEL shall be determined from the noise element of the general plan of the local jurisdiction.</p>
<p>When aircraft noise is not the only significant source, noise levels from all sources shall be added to determine the composite site noise level.</p>
<p><b>1207.11.4 Other noise sources.</b> Residential structures to be located where the Ldn or CNEL exceeds 60 db shall require an acoustical analysis showing that the proposed design will limit exterior noise to the prescribed allowable interior level. The noise element of the local general plan shall be used to the greatest extent possible to identify sites with noise levels potentially greater than 60 db.</p></div>
<p><b>1207.12 Compliance.</b> Evidence of compliance shall consist of submittal of an acoustical analysis report, prepared under the supervision of a person experienced in the field of acoustical engineering, with the application for a building permit. The report shall show topographical relationships of noise sources and dwelling sites, identification of noise sources and their characteristics, predicted noise spectra and levels at the exterior of the proposed dwelling structure considering present and future land usage, basis for the prediction (measured or obtained from published data), noise attenuation measures to be applied, and an analysis of the noise insulation effectiveness of the proposed construction showing that the prescribed interior noise level requirements are met.</p>
<p>If interior allowable noise levels are met by requiring that windows be unopenable or closed, the design for the structure must also specify a ventilation or air-conditioning system to provide a habitable interior environment. The ventilation system must not compromise the dwelling unit or guest room noise reduction.</p>
<p><b>1207.13 Field testing.</b> When inspection indicates that the construction is not in accordance with the approved design, or that the noise reduction is compromised due to sound leaks or flanking paths, field testing may be required. A test report showing compliance or noncompliance with prescribed interior allowable levels shall be submitted to the building official.</p>
<p>Measurements of outdoor sound levels shall generally follow the guidelines in ASTM E 1014.</p>
<p>Field measurements of the A-weighted airborne sound insulation of buildings from exterior sources shall generally follow the guidelines in ASTM E 966.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this standard, sound level differences measured in unoccupied units shall be normalized to a receiving room reverberation time of one-half second. Sound level differences measured in occupied units shall not be normalized to a standard reverberation time.</p>
